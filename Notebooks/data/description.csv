4,"Deadly germs sprayed in shopping malls, bomb-lets spewing anthrax spores over battlefields, tiny vials of plague scattered in Times Square -- these are the poor man's hydrogen bombs, hideous weapons of mass destruction that can be made in a simple laboratory. In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad of The New York Times uncover the truth about biological weapons and show why bio-warfare and bio-terrorism are fast becoming our worst national nightmare.  Among the startling revelations in Germs:   How the CIA secretly built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb, alarming some officials who felt the work pushed to the limits of what is permitted by the global treaty banning germ arms. How the Pentagon embarked on a secret effort to make a superbug. Details about the Soviet Union's massive hidden program to produce biological weapons, including new charges that germs were tested on humans. How Moscow's scientists made an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. The Pentagon's chaotic efforts to improvise defenses against Iraq's biological weapons during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. How a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s sickened hundreds of Americans in a bio-terrorism attack that the government played down to avoid panic and copycat strikes. Plans by the U.S. military in the 1960s to attack Cuba with germ weapons.   Germs also shows how a small group of scientists and senior officials persuaded President Bill Clinton to launch a controversial multibillion-dollar program to detect a germ attack on U.S. soil and to aid its victims -- a program that, so far, is struggling to provide real protection.  Based on hundreds of interviews with scientists and senior officials, including President Clinton, as well as on recently declassified documents and on-site reporting from the former Soviet Union's sinister bio-weapons labs, Germs shows us bio-warriors past and present at work at their trade. There is the American scientist who devoted his professional life to perfecting biological weapons, and the Nobel laureate who helped pioneer the new biology of genetically modified germs and is now trying to stop its misuse. We meet former Soviet scientists who made enough plague, smallpox, and anthrax to kill everyone on Earth and whose expertise is now in great demand by terrorists, rogue states, and legitimate research labs alike.  A frightening and unforgettable narrative of cutting-edge science and spycraft, Germs shows us why advances in biology and the spread of germ weapons expertise to such countries as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea could make germs the weapon of the twenty-first century."

6,"A New York Times Notable Book of the YearThis haunting, harrowing, gloriously moving recollection of a life on the American margin is the story of Rick Bragg, who grew up dirt-poor in northeastern Alabama, seemingly destined for either the cotton mills or the penitentiary, and instead became a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times. It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family. The result is unforgettable."
7,"As a top aide to powerful Texas Congressman Ronald Coleman, John Jackley watched the nation's highest elected officials lie, manipulate media images, and spend millions of taxpayer dollars to stay in power. The mind-boggling scope of the abuse of perks and privilege by both legislators and their staffers finally shocked him into reality.What began as a secret journal for his children to clear his conscience has become Hill Rat, a journey behind Congress' closed doors and into the corrupt back alleys of power. With both humor and outrage, Jackley reveals how the promise of Congress has been hijacked and corrupted by the current crop of careerist incumbents. ""Today,"" he writes, ""a successful congressman has the fundraising ability of a hooker trying to make cab fare home and the morals of a big-time football coach!""His account is laced with the names of Capitol Hill's most prominent legislators--Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Thomas Luken, and scores of others. Jackley also reveals, with names, dates, and examples, the outrageous power of Congressional staffers--""Hill Rats""--who ""run the engines of democracy on a daily basis and pride themselves on their ability to do anything in the name of their cause.""To show the flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money for re-election purposes, Jackley points out that in just forty-eight hours in early 1992, the House mailed more than 58 million newsletters and postcards. In 1990, the first post-Jim Wright, post-congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were reelected. Even in 1988, only six Members running for re-election were defeated, a turnover rate less than that of the Soviet Politburo.From previously untold Congressional involvement in Oliver North's contra re-supply network to Democratic complicity in the S&L crisis to the taxpayer-funded incumbent protection plan, Hill Rat reveals secrets backed by hard evidence that will shake the House and shock the nation."

10,"It was a wonderful summer, a great memory, the kind of love everybody ought to have. It changed my life - or almost did - and I think about it more than I should, but that was a long time ago.Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Catskill Mountains, Avrum Feldman listened to the haunting voice of Amelita Galli-Curci ringing over the Shandaken Valley - a voice no one else could hear. When he died at age one hundred six, his obsession for the famous opera diva had lasted three-quarters of a century. Most people considered Avrum crazy, someone preoccupied with romantic nonsense. But Madison Lee ""Bobo"" Murphy was not among them, for he, too, had a love that changed his life, or almost did: Amy Lourie.In the summer of 1955, Bobo was a waiter at the Catskill's Pine Hill Inn; a rural Southerner who had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum - a retired furrier, teacher, and translator from New York City - became his unlikely friend. For Bobo nothing about that summer ever lost its glow: his first taste of kartoffel suppe; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; the girl he met and loved....In everyone's life, Avrum had instructed, there is one grand, undeniable moment of change that never stops mattering. It came for Bobo in his first meeting with Amy, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was too naive to comprehend the gulf between their worlds, and she was too smitten by him to care. But for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo to learn the painful lesson of loving someone and believing you cannot be with them.Now, thirty-eight years later, Avrum is gone, leaving a will that beckons Bobo north to the Catskills once more. In the places he'd walked so often on the paths of memory, he embraces the ghosts of old friendships and the haunting hints of Amy's presence, until she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand between who they were and who they have become. The strikes against them are different now, but mysteriously, miraculously, as Bobo carries out Avrum's last wishes for a strange Kaddish, he hears the dreams of his youth, of the young man who went forth and became part of a love larger than himself...."
11,"For the first time ever, veteran World War II cryptographer Hervie Haufler details how American and British codebreakers were the decisive factor in the Allied victory. From the Purple Machine to the Navajo Talkers to the breaking of Japan's JN-25 Naval Code to the shadowy world of decoding units like Hut-8 in Bletchley Park, he shows how crucial information-often obtained by surreptitious and violent means-was the decisive edge in the Battle of Britain, at Midway and against the U-Boats in the North Atlantic, and how Allied intelligence saved the Soviet Union from almost certain defeat.  In an accessible account based on years of research, interviews and exclusive access to previously top-secret archives, Haufler demonstrates how cryptography enabled Nimitz and MacArthur to persevere in the Pacific and helped Eisenhower and Patton mount the assaults on Normandy. In compelling detail, Haufler shows us how it was done-as only one who was on the frontlines of the ""secret war"" could tell it."

13,"Sometimes in their chanting monks will land upon a note and sing it in florid fashion, one syllable of text for fifty notes of chant. Melisma, they call it.Living a melismatic life in imitation of plainchant, we may stop on an experience, a place, a person, or a memory and rhapsodize in imagination. Some like to meditate or contemplate melismatically, while others prefer to draw, build, paint, or dance whatever their eye has fallen upon.Living one point after another, is one form of experience, and it can be emphatically productive. But stopping for melisma gives the soul its reason for being."

17,"From the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People comes an inspiring new bestseller that puts human feelings of guilt and inadequacy in perspective - and teaches us how we can learn to accept ourselves and others even when we and they are less than perfect. How Good Do We Have to Be? is for everyone who experiences that sense of guilt and disappointment. Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God's love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology,,and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human."

21,"Even if you know Sandra Bernhard as an actress, singer, comedian, and performer, you're in for quite a shock with this, her second book. A mix of memoir, fiction, invented memoir, and fiction that rings with the truth, Love Love and Love charts the state of romance, sex, and relationships - the need to love and be loved - in several cities, and several sexes, around the world. The same biting wit, fragile irony, and arresting candor of Sandra's performances are all here, but Love Love and Love is also filled with an intimacy and an insight that are all new... and all Bernhard.Here are the stories of a relationship built on the weapon of romance; of an elusive girl, and the various drugs she gives and takes; of dreams and daydreams that melt into truth; of the touch of a lover's skin at the break of dawn; and of all the pain and cruelty that go along so well with the ecstasy we all want to possess. This is a book about relationships born of chance meetings on the street at night; about sexual obsessions, frayed emotions, and haunting memories of both the quick and the dead. Love Love and Love is by turns shocking and exhilarating, angry and passionate, analytical and sexy; it's all about that strange state of being that merges sensations only of the moment with an emotion that has existed since the birth of humankind.As Sandra herself notes: ""Love is the only shocking act left on the face of the earth."""
22,"On December 16, 1994, a bloodletting took place in the stylish sixth-floor boardroom at Saatchi & Saatchi Company PLC, once the world's largest advertising agency holding company. Maurice Saatchi, the 48 year-old chairman who co-founded the company in 1970 with his older brother Charles, was fired by the board of directors under threat by the firm's largest shareholders. Less than a month later, Maurice started a rival ad agency and quickly snapped up former Saatchi & Saatchi clients, most importantly British Airways. Kevin Goldman, the former daily advertising columnist for the Wall Street Journal, spoke to everyone connected with this headline-making saga -- including Maurice Saatchi and his reclusive brother Charles -- and witnessed important business meetings, including Maurice Saatchi's winning pitch to British Airways. Goldman traces every step the Saatchi brothers took, from their youth as Iraqi Jewish immigrants in North London to their business merger in 1970, when, with little more than sheer audacity, the opened an ad agency with a full-page announcement ad in the London Sunday Times. Through bold and brash actions, the agency began an acquisitions binge, taking over many of the ad industry's giants -- including Ted Bates, Backer & Spielvogel, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and Garland-Compton -- to become the number one ad company in the world. But, once they acquired a company, the brothers lost interest, often refusing to meet with its executives again. This disdain would come back to haunt them. Also chronicled is the brothers' rich lifestyle, which critics claim was funded by the company. This tale features a rich cast of supporting players: Jeremy Sinclair, a creative advertising genius who was fiercely loyal to the brothers, was one of the executives who resigned after Maurice was fired. Bill Muirhead, another loyalist, was responsible for keeping clients happy. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a globe-trotting native of France, was brought in by the Saatchis in 1989 when the company was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Louis-Dreyfus brought in Charles Scott, a self-described numbers cruncher uncomfortable with the glitzy world of advertising, to help sort out the company's complex finances. And leading the anti-Maurice movement was David Herro, a thirty-three-year-old American money manager whose group owned approximately 10 percent of Saatchi stock. Built into the Saatchi story is the bigger picture of the dramatic changes in advertising in the 1980s, such as the merger mania and ad agency consolidations that swept Madison Avenue, including the British takeover of major agencies. The story of the decline and crash of Saatchi & Saatchi is a universal tale of corporate greed and ineffective management. It is the story of an ugly, publicly fought civil war in an industry that is supposed to know the steep price paid for an image run amok."

29,"""The chasm is where high-tech fortunes are lost... the tornado is where they are made.""-- Steve Jobs, Founder & CEO, Next Computer, Inc.    Now, in this fascinating sequel, Moore shows how to capitalize on the profit-rich niches and hyper-growth markets beyond the chasm. Continuing to chart the impact of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, he explores its effects not just on marketing but on overall business planning, especially strategic partnerships, competitive advantage, positioning and organizational leadership. Moore's most startling lesson is: ""As markets move from stage to stage in the Life Cycle, the winning strategy does not just change -- it actually reverses the prior strategy. The very skills that you've just perfected become your biggest liabilities; and if you can't put them aside to acquire new ones, then you're in for tough times."" As challenging as this lesson is to apply, Moore leads the way. Using actual examples of cutting-edge firms, he applies the Life Cycle model to all aspects of managing a market-focused business strategy, including how to manage people effectively through each phase of the cycle. There are significant management implications: Chasm-crossers who love the customer intimacy of niches may rebel against the depersonalizing power of the tornado; tornado managers who relish the gales of hyper-growth may resist the inevitable return to the niche, in the guise of mass customization, once the rush to the new paradigm subsides. All industries relying on technology -- not just computer hardware, software and telecommunications, but entertainment, publishing, broadcasting, banking, insurance, health care, aerospace, defense, utilities, pharmaceuticals and retail -- must master Moore's lessons to see the year 2000. If you are marketing technology-based products or managing the people who do, then you will find yourself Inside the Tornado."

A testament to the power of the single voice, Going the Other Way is an exemplary American tale that points the way toward a more perfect game, one in which all men and women can pursue their athletic dreams free of prejudice and discrimination. An eight-page photo insert is featured in this New York Times bestseller."

57,"Renowned as a novelist of unsurpassed invention, Carlos Fuentes here presents his second collection of stories to appear in English. Where his first,Burnt Water, published in 1980, had as its underlying theme Mexico City itself,Constancia and Other Stories for Virgins extends its imaginative boundaries out to Savannah, to Cadiz, to Glasgow, to Seville and Madrid, both past and present. This new collection is more mysterious, more magical, too, than its predecessor, and in its five related stories Fuentes comes closer to the registers of language and feeling that he explored so memorably inAura. It reveals Fuentes at the height of his powers--bold, erudite, enthralling.In the title story, a man discovers his wife's secret complicity with the Russian actor who is their neighbor--a complicity that includes not just a previous life but possibly a previous death as well. He finds himself ""a mediator . . . a point between one sorrow and the next, between one hope and the next, between two languages, two memories, two ages, and two deaths."" In ""La Desdichada,"" two students steal--and fall in love with--a store-window mannequin. In ""The Prisoner of Las Lomas,"" a wealthy lawyer in possession of a powerful secret is held hostage by the past he has attempted to subvert and keep at bay. The celebrated bullfighter whose fame is the theme of ""Viva Mi Fama"" steps from the present into a past immortalized by Goya's portrait of the matador Pedro Romero; and the architects who are the ""Reasonable People"" of that story find themselves drawn into the irrational mysteries not only of religious fervor but of their famous mentor's identity--they discover ""there are no empty houses,"" only a present fraught with the past.Though each of these novella-length stories offers compelling evidence of Fuentes's talent for narrative free rein as well as for containment and closure, they are also brilliantly interwoven. Readers of his earlier work, especially of his acclaimed ribald epic, Christopher Unborn, will recognize with pleasure Fuentes's undiminished mastery of recurrent images and themes, and all readers will delight in the witty and evocative changes he rings on them. For those few readers who do not yet know the work of Mexico's foremost man of letters, these stories offer them the full gift of his imaginative resourcefulness."

64,"Throughout the world, languages differ, but the business questions are the same. In French and Japanese, Hebrew and English, executives are asking, ""How can I survive and thrive in the borderless, global marketplace?""  For answers, the authors of Global Literacies went straight to the leaders themselves -- the CEOs of thousands of corporations around the globe.  Two lessons emerged. First, there are leadership universals that every executive and manager needs to practice in order to be world-class at home and abroad. The second defied conventional wisdom: in the borderless economy, culture doesn't matter less, it matters more.  Around the world, business leaders apply their own experiences -- personal, professional, and cultural -- to an ever-expanding world of Dutch colleagues, Brazilian suppliers, Taiwanese manufacturers, and Chinese competitors. These leaders are trying to become globally literate...and Global Literacies is for, and about, them.  No one knows this better than CEOs of successful global companies such as Japan's Canon, Sweden's Ericsson, Taiwan's Acer Computers, the U.K.'s British Telecommunications, and U.S.-based Coca-Cola.  In Global Literacies, a team of researchers led by Robert Rosen, Ph.D., of Healthy Companies International, and Watson Wyatt Worldwide have produced the first model of international business success based on a wide-ranging landmark study of global leaders and their world-class companies. Global Literacies documents the exclusive results of a worldwide survey of over one thousand senior executives and in-depth interviews with CEOs of seventy-eight companies -- companies representing 3.5 million employees in more than 200 countries, and with more than $725 billion in annual sales.  Global Literacies offers compelling new insights and business tools:  The Global Leadership Universals  Learn the new literacies of business:  * Personal Literacy -- understanding and valuing yourself * Social Literacy -- engaging and challenging people * Business Literacy -- focusing and mobilizing your business * Cultural Literacy -- valuing and leveraging cultural difference  The Global Success Quotient  Learn which are the most globally active, financially successful companies -- and countries -- in the world, understand how they got there, and apply those learnings to your own organization.  The Cultures of Twenty-first-Century Business  Develop ways to see global challenges and opportunities, think with an international mindset, act with fresh global-centric leadership behaviors, and mobilize world-class companies -- whether you're a multinational giant, a domestic manufacturer, or a local community organization.  National Profiles  With sophisticated profiles of thirty countries, and survey data from eighteen national cultures -- from the Tolerant Traders of the Netherlands to China's Ancient Modernizers and the Optimistic Entrepreneurs of the United States, Global Literacies is a groundbreaking and fascinating work on the most important issues in the world of business today."

66,"Joyce Mitchell was widowed far too young when her beloved husband, Mitch, died in a tragic accident five years ago. Since then she's kept her hands full and her mind and heart occupied by running The Sewing Circus, an all-girl group she founded to provide badly needed services like day care and job counseling to young women, many of whom are single mothers. More important, The Circus is a place for lively, wide-ranging, heart-to-heart discussions that will help members grow into what Joyce likes to call ""twenty-first-century free women.""All in all, Joyce has a full and rich life. She has her work, her family, her friends, and her town. But there are some nights when she crawls into bed alone and has to admit that something is missing. What she doesn't have is that red dress she keeps dreaming about or a social life that would accommodate it even if she braved the mail and bought one. To further complicate matters, she may not have The Sewing Circus much longer, as the state legislature has decided not to fund the group's vital but hard-todefine work with young women who are too often regarded as problems rather than possibilities.Feeling defeated and pessimistic, Joyce reluctantly agrees to keep a date for dinner at the home of her best friend, Sister -- a reverend like no other-and finds not only a perfect meal but a tall, dark stranger named Nate Anderson. Nate has just joined the administration at the high school and his unexpected presence in Idlewild touches a chord in Joyce that she thought her heart had forgotten how to play. Nate feels the same immediate connection, but both have enough experience with broken hearts to take it real slow. Besides, they've got too much work to do to concentrate on falling in love....But life moves at its own pace, and as Sister says, ""if you want to make God laugh, make plans."" Particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Joyce decides the trick is to stay focused and to remember that nothing is as sexy as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, especially if you tell it while you're wearing a perfect red dress...."
67,"The Flynn girls, just two of a seemingly endless number of Flynn children, are naturally curious about where their little siblings come from. Well versed in the bizarre lives and gruesome deaths of their favorite saints, they have yet to crack the mysteries of the more earthly concerns of procreation and human relations. Blessed enlightenment comes, however, when the Virgin Mary appears and asks them to buy her suitable clothes for her earthly mission -- a campaign for birth control. Set against the backdrop of the impending Vatican II decisions that wreaked havoc on many Catholic lives and the sprawl of the more permissive 1960s, this crackling, smart, and thoughtful novel is sure to delight."

70,"The spirit of adventure is at the heart of Jonathan Spence's widely acclaimed scholarship on the modern history of China. This vitality, fleshed out with deep research and attired in elegant style, has drawn countless readers to subjects otherwise approachable only by experts. Through eight books, from the story of the early eighteenth century Manchu bondservant Ts'ao Yin to his magisterial history, The Search for Modern China, Spence has made the excitement of intellectual discovery palpable for us all. In the course of his fruitful career Spence has written many shorter pieces as well, and the best of these are collected for the first time in Chinese Roundabout. Here the reader will meet Arcadio Huang, the Chinese linguist and Christian convert who moves from south China to Enlightenment Paris, marries a French woman, and in conversations with Montesquieu becomes the likely source for the Persian Letters. The poignant story of Huang's hard-won success and final defeat by poverty and disease illustrates the perils of crossing cultures. Spence's delight in intellectual risk animates his Shakespearean approach to the life of the great Qing emperor in ""The Seven Ages of K'ang-hsi."" Spence's great learning informs an authoritative essay on China's tragic experience with opium. Following the social process of addiction from the cultivation of poppies and the processing of the drug through its introduction by the British into China, its widespread distribution and consumption by Chinese, and the public struggle to suppress opium use, Spence explores issues of historical and contemporary interest. In an equally substantial piece he focuses on the cultural dimensions of food in Qing China, illuminating the marginal diet of a peasantry constantly threatened by famine as well as the grand banquets of the literati and the imperial household. In the work of 25 years, Spence has established himself as a brilliant interpreter of modern Chinese history. His books—among them the recent national bestseller The Search for Modern China—exhibit uncommon imagination, unobtrusive learning, verve, and elegance. These same qualities animate the essays gathered here."

From Queen Maeve of Connaught to President Mary Robinson, this book presents Irish women as their compatriots—men and women both—have described and interpreted them.Modern Irish women are outspoken about the issues that rouse their passion—love and sex, marriage and divorce, abortion and adoption. As Katie Donovan says in her introduction: ""Our selection is intended to give the reader a taste of the varied spectrum, from the courtly praise of men to swinish male chauvinism; from women's declarations of outrage against church and state to their celebrations of childbirth and motherhood."" This book celebrates the vast range of women's thought and activity, their spirituality, and their passions.The women who appear in this collection are both well known and unknown, real and invented. The editors have drawn freely upon translations of the mythological tales and later Irish poems, upon letters, biographies, and newspapers as well as prose and poetry, plays, recordings and songs, in order to present a complex multilayered and richly rewarding view of Ireland's women."

Schwartz' imagination was fired by this sinister tale of love and death set in Wales, a timeless story with echoes of Thomas Hardy and Mary Webb.Joseph Pugh, sick of Oxford and of teaching, decides to take some time off to live in a wild and beautiful Welsh farm valley. There he falls physically ill and is nursed back to health by Bronwen Vaughn, the wife of a neighboring farmer.

85,"Embattled, feeling victimized and entitled, many patients once again seek out help despite previous years of unsuccessful psychotherapy or analysis. Feeling frozen and unable to change and putting up a seemingly impenetrable wall of resistance, such patients are among the most difficult to reach. In this original work, Israeli psychologist Rena Moses-Hrushovski describes her therapeutic endeavors with such patients. She discovered in many such people a specific form of narcissistic character resistance which she terms deployment. Deployment is a vigilant use of the balances of interpersonal power designed to ward off intolerable feelings, predominantly of envy, shame, and guilt. Patients who use deployment put themselves in the role of the victim and then battle against perceived injustice, abuse, and oppression for the right to be understood and accepted. Such patients often expect the therapist to take responsibility for their suffering.In addition to exploring deployment as a kind of self organization, Dr. Moses-Hrushovski details her formulation of treatment approaches that enable her to build bridges to these patients and help them uncover and live with the feeling states that they are desperately trying to ward off."

94,"According to renowned defense attorney and Harvard law professor Alan M. Dershowitz, ""abuse excuses"" are enabling people to get away with murder - literally. From the Menendez brothers to Lorena Bobbitt, more and more Americans accused of violent crimes are admitting to the charges, but arguing that they shouldn't be held legally responsible. The reason: they're victims - of an abusive parent, a violent spouse, a traumatic experience, ethnic hatred, society at large, or anything else - who struck back at a real or perceived oppressor. And they couldn't help themselves, they say.In this provocative and important collection of essays, Dershowitz reviews a wide range of recent cases - including those of O. J. Simpson, Tonya Harding, and Woody Allen - and argues that the current vogue in victim defenses is antithetical to the ideals of our constitutional democracy. For Dershowitz, the foundations of American society are individual responsibility and the rule of law. And people who claim to be above the law - whatever the excuse - are no more than vigilantes."

101,"How intelligent are horses? Why do they toss their heads and what makes them paw the ground?After spending more than twenty years studying the body language of the human species, Desmond Morris has turned his attention to the behavior of some of our closest animal companions. First he looked at dogs, then cats, and now horses. As Curator of Mammals at the London Zoo he was able to study closely the zebras and wild horse in his charge. More recently, as a racehorse owner, he has scrutinized the glamorous world of thoroughbred racing.Throughout his long involvement with horses, Desmond Morris has never stopped asking questions. InHorsewatching he sets out to answer them. As a zoologist and a lifelong student of animal behavior, he approaches the horse world in an unusual way, dealing with topics often ignored in equine literature. In addition to examining details of behavior, Dr Morris considers such questions as why horseshoes bring good luck, why we don’t eat horses, why jockeys are allowed to whip their mounts and why we call a bad dream a nightmare.And for punters everywhere, he applies his zoological mind to the all-important question of why some horses run faster than others…"

103,"There is a superstition that if an emptied theater is ever left completely dark, a ghost will take up residence. To prevent this, a single ""ghost light"" is left burning at center stage after the audience and all of the actors and musicians have gone home. Frank Rich's eloquent and moving boyhood memoir reveals how theater itself became a ghost light and a beacon of security for a child finding his way in a tumultuous world.Rich grew up in the small-townish Washington, D.C., of the 1950s and early '60s, a place where conformity seemed the key to happiness for a young boy who always felt different. When Rich was seven years old, his parents separated--at a time when divorce was still tantamount to scandal--and thereafter he and his younger sister were labeled ""children from a broken home."" Bouncing from school to school and increasingly lonely, Rich became terrified of the dark and the uncertainty of his future. But there was one thing in his life that made him sublimely happy: the Broadway theater.Rich's parents were avid theatergoers, and in happier times they would listen to the brand-new recordings of South Pacific, Damn Yankees, and The Pajama Game over and over in their living room. When his mother's remarriage brought about turbulent changes, Rich took refuge in these same records, re-creating the shows in his imagination, scene by scene. He started collecting Playbills, studied fanatically the theater listings in The New York Times and Variety, and cut out ads to create his own miniature marquees. He never imagined that one day he would be the Times's chief theater critic.Eventually Rich found a second home at Wash-ington's National Theatre, where as a teenager he was a ticket-taker and was introduced not only to the backstage magic he had dreamed of for so long but to a real-life cast of charismatic and eccentric players who would become his mentors and friends. With humor and eloquence, Rich tells the triumphant story of how the aspirations of a stagestruck young boy became a lifeline, propelling him toward the itinerant family of theater, whose romantic denizens welcomed him into the colorful fringes of Broadway during its last glamorous era.Every once in a while, a grand spectacle comes along that introduces its audiences to characters and scenes that will resound in their memories long after the curtain has gone down.Ghost Light, Frank Rich's beautifully crafted childhood memoir, is just such an event."

After all, something inside her is telling her to get back to the desert ranch - why else would she be cooking spicy Mexican meatball soup at her cottage in Maine, when clam chowder should be on the menu?But along with the excitement she feels at going home is an inexplicable sense of foreboding, which is tragically realized once she arrives in Tucson.

112,"More than twenty years ago, a disillusioned college graduate named Peter Jenkins set out with his dog Cooper to look for himself and his nation.  His memoir of what he found, A Walk Across America, captured the hearts of millions of Americans.Now, Peter is a bit older, married with a family, and his journeys are different than they were. Perhaps he is looking for adventure, perhaps inspiration, perhaps new communities, perhaps unspoiled land.  Certainly, he found all of this and more in Alaska, America's last wilderness.Looking for Alaska is Peter's account of eighteen months spent traveling over twenty thousand miles in tiny bush planes, on snow machines and snowshoes, in fishing boats and kayaks, on the Alaska Marine Highway and the Haul Road, searching for what defines Alaska. Hearing the amazing stories of many real Alaskans--from Barrow to Craig, Seward to Deering, and everywhere in between--Peter gets to know this place in the way that only he can. His resulting portrait is a rare and unforgettable depiction of a dangerous and beautiful land and all the people that call it home.  He also took his wife and eight-year-old daughter with him, settling into a ""home base"" in Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, coming and going from there, and hosting the rest of their family for extended visits. The way his family lived, how they made Alaska their home and even participated in Peter's explorations, is as much a part of this story as Peter's own travels.All in all, Jenkins delivers a warm, funny, awe-inspiring, and memorable diary of discovery-both of this place that captures all of our imaginations, and of himself, all over again."

128,"An extraordinarily frank, honest, and generous book by one of America's most famous and admired women -- a book that is, as its title suggests, composed of both personal memoir and history.It is the story of Graham's parents: the multimillionaire father who left private business and government service to buy and restore the down-and-out Washington Post, and the formidable, self-absorbed mother who was more interested in her political and charity work, and her passionate friendships with men like Thomas Mann and Adlai Stevenson, than in her children.It is the story of how The Washington Post struggled to succeed -- a fascinating and instructive business history as told from the inside (the paper has been run by Graham herself, her father, her husband, and now her son).It is the story of Phil Graham -- Kay's brilliant, charismatic husband (he clerked for two Supreme Court justices) -- whose plunge into manic-depression, betrayal, and eventual suicide is movingly and charitably recounted. Best of all, it is the story of Kay Graham herself. She was brought up in a family of great wealth, yet she learned and understood nothing about money. She is half-Jewish, yet -- incredibly -- remained unaware of it for many years.She describes herself as having been naive and awkward, yet intelligent and energetic. She married a man she worshipped, and he fascinated and educated her, and then, in his illness, turned from her and abused her. This destruction of her confidence and happiness is a drama in itself, followed by the even more intense drama of her new life as the head of a great newspaper and a great company, a famous (and even feared) woman in her own right. Hers is a life that came into its own with a vengeance -- a success story on every level.Graham's book is populated with a cast of fascinating characters, from fifty years of presidents (and their wives), to Steichen, Brancusi, Felix Frankfurter, Warren Buffett (her great advisor and protector), Robert McNamara, George Schultz (her regular tennis partner), and, of course, the great names from the Post: Woodward, Bernstein, and Graham's editor/partner, Ben Bradlee. She writes of them, and of the most dramatic moments of her stewardship of the Post (including the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, and the pressmen's strike), with acuity, humor, and good judgment. Her book is about learning by doing, about growing and growing up, about Washington, and about a woman liberated by both circumstance and her own great strengths."

Now, in Sheila, he explores the making of evil - the depths beneath the lower depths of American society and the terrifying products of that netherworld where children are born into ultimate abandonment and abuse, where only a few survive and some emerge not fully human.One such survivor is the man known as Ghost.His personality has been formed, diamond-hard, in the crucible of chilly orphanages and hellish juvenile prisons. He has grown the way a baby alligator grows - in size alone, not in essence. He has no experience of nurture or education.He has become an instrument. A weapon to be used by predators. He works only with his hands. His work - his art - is killing. He is a superb killer: imaginative, efficient, precise, cold. He easily finds employment. When he does time, he emerges from prison neither hurt nor healed - exactly as before.But now he is no longer drifting. He has a mission that enlists all his banked energies: to track the woman who calls herself Sheila. She is a runway dancer. She is, like himself, a survivor of her own destruction, kept alive by anger. But Ghost knows that she has, for an instant, glimpsed the man behind the steel mask he wears, and that she is as astonished as he to find someone to connect with.Sheila has disappeared. And Ghost - desperate to reconnect - discovers the only route that might lead him back to her: straight through the cruel alleys, the topless bars, the dark tunnels of pornography and prostitution, into the raging center of a neo-Nazi enclave whose leader is instantly drawn to him...Sheila is the story of a killer stalking his destined prey, driven by forces he cannot understand.

136,"For over three decades, Reynolds Price has been one of America's most distinguished writers, in a career that has been remarkable both for its virtuosity and for the variety of literary forms he has embraced. Now he shows himself as much a master of the story as he is of the novel, in a volume that presents fifty stories, including two early collections - The Names and Faces of Heroes and Permanent Errors - as well as more than two dozen new stories that have never been gathered together before.In his introduction, Mr. Price explains how, after the publication of his first two collections, he wrote no new stories for almost twenty years. ""But once I needed - for unknown reasons in a new and radically altered life - to return to the story, it opened before me like a new chance...A collection like this then,"" he adds, ""...will show a writer's pre-occupations in ways the novel severely rations (novels are partly made for that purpose - the release from self, long flights through the Other). John Keats's assertion that 'the excellence of every Art is its intensity' has served as a license and standard for me. From the start my stories were driven by heat - passion and mystery, often passion for the mystery I've found in particular rooms and spaces and the people they threaten or shelter - and my general aim is the transfer of a spell of keen witness, perceived by the reader as warranted in character and act.""There is, indeed, much for the reader to ""witness"" here of passion and mystery, of character and act. And the variety of stories - many of them set in Reynolds Price's native North Carolina, but a surprising number set in distant parts: Jerusalem in ""An Early Christmas,"" the American Southwest in ""Walking Lessons,"" and a number in Europe - will astonish even his most devoted readers. In short, The Collected Stories of Reynolds Price is as deeply rewarding a book as any he has yet published."

147,"From the world-acclaimed author of Coming of Age in the Milky Way comes this delightfully engrossing, comprehensive, and comprehensible report on how science today envisions the universe as a whole.Timothy Ferris begins The Whole Shebang with a succinct account of how we have come to know what we know about the universe. Then he explains the meaning behind the exciting new developments that have put cosmology in the headlines -- including the discovery of planets orbiting stars other than our sun, glimpses through the Hubble Space Telescope of how the universe looked when it was only a fraction of its present age, and the detection of structure in relic radiation from the big bang that may hint at the mechanisms of genesis.Ferris provides a lucid, nontechnical overview of current research and a forecast of where cosmological theory is likely to go in the twenty-first century. A master analogist, he presents accessible explanations of relativity and quantum physics, ""inflationary"" models indicating that the universe is much larger than had been thought, and ""string"" theories that portray all matter as made of space.The centerpiece of The Whole Shebang is a visionary account of near-future science, in which light is shed on the possibility that our universe is one among many universes, each with different physical laws and differing prospects for the emergence of life.The Whole Shebang explores questions that have occurred to even casual readers who are curious about nature on the largest scales: What does it mean to say that the universe is ""expanding,"" or that space is ""curved""? How could there have been an ""origin"" of the universe; what happened ""before""? Why is quantum uncertainty so puzzling to many scientists, and why do some regard it as one of theWritten with the literary flair that earned Ferris the accolade ""the greatest science writer in the world,"" The Whole Shebang interweaves probing scientific explication, lyrical descriptions, and finely honed profiles of the lives and personalities of the scientists and philosophers who have contributed to human understanding of the cosmos.

Now Dr. Weil -- whose nationwide bestsellersSpontaneous Healing and Eight Weeks to Optimum Health have made us aware of the body's capacitiy to heal itself -- provides us with a program for improving our well-being by making informed choices about how and what we eat.Dr. Weil makes clear how an optimal diet can both supply the basic needs of the body and fortify the body's defenses and mechanisms of healing. And he always stresses that good food -- and the good feeling it engenders at the table -- is not only a delight but also necessary to our well being so that eating for health means enjoyable eating.Eating Well for Optimum Health is a hugely practical and inspiring book about food, diet and nutrition that stands to change -- for the better and the healthier -- our most fundamental ideas about eating."

150,"For many Americans, the Gulf War served as an introduction to a part of the world about which they knew virtually nothing. It provided a kind of mass-marketed crash course in Middle Eastern politics, tradition, and history.But what did they learn?In Lines in the Sand, veteran Middle East journalist Deborah Amos provides a unique perspective on the war, looking beyond the stories that were reported over and over to get at the truth about the events that led up to the conflict, and to examine a year later the effects it had on the people of the region.Among the issues she explores are how America armed Hussein, providing him with much of the power and expertise he demonstrated in overrunning Kuwait; how the collapse of the Soviet Union led to dramatic changes in U.S. policy toward Iraq, which the Americans had supported in its long war with Iran; how the rich Arabs of the Gulf states found a common strategy with their poorer neighbors; how the PLO, forced to deal with an intra-Arab conflict that included Israeli influence on one side, came to support Hussein; how Saudi domestic policies affected U.S. military strategies how the burgeoning resistance movement in Kuwait was crushed after the war; and, how, despite the war and the upheaval among so many nations, very little of substance has truly changed.Deborah Amos brings a fresh perspective to the war, with new insights into the region's history and culture. She explores the volatility of the region and concludes that it is as unstable now as before. Most significantly, she looks at the war not just from a U.S. perspective, but from the point of view of Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.Lines in the Sand is dramatic war reporting at its best, by a top female journalist covering the first war in which the American military put women on the frontlines--and, ironically, from a place in which women aren't even allowed to drive."

152,"""What would it take for you to change the course of your life?"" reads the first sentence of The Courage to Be Rich, a book that goes beyond the phenomenal success of The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom in challenging and inspiring us to realize our full financial potential, and to realize as well that the bottom line of life is comprised of much more than money. Why does it take courage to be rich? Because it takes courage to meet every obstacle and opportunity of life, to forgive ourselves and others for past mistakes, to imagine and achieve a future rich with possibility.   With her signature blend of inspirational and practical advice, Suze Orman asks us to look within, asserting her powerful conviction that once we achieve a state of emotional clarity regarding money, financial clarity will always follow. She guides us through a lifetime of financial issues, from relationships and prenuptial agreements to investment options, from the money we spend in daily life to the money we need for tomorrow. Finally, Suze takes on the seldom-explored subject of money and grace, the rewards it bestows and the responsibilities it confers.   Suze Orman may be the only financial planner for whom words like ""hope,"" ""acceptance,"" and ""courage"" are part of her daily lexicon. The Courage to Be Rich is a book that will change our very definitions of wealth and abundance."

155,"Although the stars of Russian ballet Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina possessed a national manner of dancing, there was no truly Russian school of dancing until the 1930s. The development of this school was largely due to Mme. Vaganova (1879–1951), not only a great dancer but also the teacher of Galina Ulanova and many others and an unsurpassed theoretician.The principles of Vaganova's system are presented in this well-known book. Mme. Vaganova's aim of creating a personal approach to the Russian dance was based on the critical assimilation of the experience of her contemporaries. Her ability to choose the best of what had been accomplished in the various ballet traditions (French, Italian, and Russian) and combine these into a unified teaching practice in itself amounted to a new school of dance. She firmly believed that the teaching process should be a planned exercise, ever changing with innovations in the dance. She sought from her pupils emotional expressiveness, strictness of form, a resolute, energetic manner of performance, and the understanding of the underlying coordination of movements.Her book discusses all basic principles of ballet, grouping movements by fundamental types. Chapters cover battements, rotary movements of the legs, the arms, poses of the classical dance, connecting and auxiliary movements, jumps, beats, point work, and turns as well as material for a sample lesson. Diagrams show clearly the exact foot, leg, arm, and body positions for the proper execution of many steps and movements. The result is a fundamental theory of dance that offers dancers, teachers, and ballet lovers information often difficult to locate in other books. 118 illustrations."

Now Cal is about to topple baseball's most unbreakable record - Lou Gehrig's incredible streak of 2,130 consecutive games played.Iron Man chronicles Junior's ascent to superstardom.

What made him choose the strike over the Streak?"

But when Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr., reported to the baseball field on September 6, 1995, for a record-breaking 2,131st consecutive time, Americans felt otherwise. In an era of big-money sports, strikes, and grandstanding, the hardest-working ballplayer in the world had single-handedly put the ""great"" back in America's greatest game.Now, with the candor and grace that have endeared him to fans, Ripken tells the story of his journey to that moment and beyond.Best of all, Cal takes us inside the brain of one of the game's smartest players.

173,"As Americans, we face two fundamental questions:First, are we truly prepared to fight this new war to wipe out terrorism and terrorist regimes, and win it decisively -- no matter what sacrifices it requires or how long it takes?Second, are we once again prepared to teach our children the fundamental principles and values that make this country great -- the values that make this country worth fighting for, living for, and dying for?Sean Hannity is the hottest new phenomenon in TV and talk radio today. His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world -- political, social, and cultural -- as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left -- the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack -- by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic issues like taxation, education, patriotism, and the family have been exploited by liberals with their own agendas -- with potentially disastrous results.Filled with the commonsense commentary and passionate argument that have made Sean Hannity the most compelling conservative voice since Rush Limbaugh, Let Freedom Ring is an urgent call to arms. For, as Hannity warns, ""We are engaged in a war of ideas. And civilization is at stake."""
174,"This edition of Hamlet represents a radically new text of the best known and most widely discussed of all Shakespearean tragedies.

Introducing fresh theatrical momentum, this revision provides, as Shakespeare intended, a better, more practical acting script."

199,"Every day the newspapers report more corporate mergers and restructuring. Every day thousands of lives are altered by these changes. Most managers and employees, however, do not have the experience to effectively work through such transitions. In Managing Transitions, William Bridges provides a clear understanding of what change does to employees and what employees in transition can do to an organization, and he shows how to minimize the distress and disruptions caused by change.Directed at managers and employees in today&#39;s corporations, where change is necessary to revitalize and improve corporate performance, Managing Transitions  addresses the fact that it is people who have to carry out the change. It not only talks about what should be done, but also shows how to do it, giving managers practical ways to bring the people ”on board.” Armed with this new information, managers will look at future changes in a new way, no longer feeling anxious and hopeless, but rather looking at opportunities.Everybody talks about ”managing change” and ”resistance to change,” but Bridges is the first to talk about what is going on inside the people who have to make the change work. He is the first to provide any real sense of the emotional impact of change and what can be done to keep it from disrupting the entire organization. Bridges&#39;s years of experience helping organizations and individuals successfully take control of change has proven the need for specific, concrete guidelines for dealing with change.  Managing Transitions provides these guidelines."
200,"The World Bank is the single biggest source of finance for international development, and its policies have a critical impact on the future of more than 110 borrowing countries. In this dramatic and lively new critique, Bruce Rich, internationally known expert on the environment and the World Bank, analyzes how the Bank has become a seemingly unstoppable and often destructive environmental and political force.The author chronicles the life-and-death impact of Bank-funded projects around the world: huge dams that have forced the resettlement of millions of the poorest people on earth, road building and jungle colonization schemes in Brazil, Indonesia, and Africa that have left vast deforestation and social conflict in their wake, and much more. Rich also recounts the bold grassroots campaigns of nongovernmental groups seeking alternatives to Bank-style development.Confidential internal Bank documents expose chronic misrepresentations by Bank management to its donor nations and to the public. Rich reveals how senior officials continue to push money into projects with disastrous ecological and human rights consequences, despite early and persistent protests of Bank staff. He shows how repeatedly and without political accountability the Bank has increased its support for regimes that torture and murder their subjects, from Ceaucescu's Romania to Suharto's Indonesia.Mortgaging the Earth explains the so-called pressure to lend that emerges as a leitmotif in the Bank's fifty-year history and shows how this institutional dynamic has taken on a damaging life of its own. Rich traces the history of the Bank, from its inception at Bretton Woods, where it was conceived as a way to funnel reconstruction loans for war-torn Europe, through the surreally top-down tenure of Robert McNamara to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. At Rio, governments poured billions of dollars more into the Bank to save our global environment - while the Bank financed new ecological disasters.The World Bank, Rich demonstrates in a provocative history of development from Descartes to Max Weber to Chico Mendes, is a crucible of the goals of the modern age, goals that in the very moment of their worldwide triumph have become problematic. He shows how the Bank's dilemmas mirror our global civilization's crisis of values and gives expert prescription for reform.Mortgaging the Earth makes disturbingly clear why every American should be concerned about the World Bank, as a critical arena where the global politics of technology, development, and the environment are played out on a small planet, one where the stakes are increasingly for keeps."

205,"What was it like to live in the ancient land watered by the Nile, thousands of years before Christ was born? How did a man earn his living, what did he wear, where did he go in his leisure time? What was the relationship between an ordinary Egyptian and his government, his wife, his children? Was life for him grim or optimistic, difficult or easy, reverent or worldly? Did his people travel, explore, conquer? Were they very much different from those of the other great civilizations of antiquity, the Greek and the Roman? What was the nature of their science, art, magic, religion? If the past has lessons for the present, what can we deduce from ancient Egyptian life that is of value to us today?For generations, scholar, specialists, and general readers have been turning to a monumental sourcebook for the answers to such questions: Life in Ancient Egypt by Adolf Erman. It is one of the most influential and frequently consulted works on Egyptology ever written, a classic in its field and the basis of numerous other studies and works. It is still one of a very few books that offer the modern reader so satisfying, informative, and complete a survey in one volume.Erman, a rigorously trained scholar, Director of the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, and author of standard works on Egyptology, covers his subject thoroughly and with a wealth of interesting, concrete detail. He examines ancient Egypt’s political structure, crime and police systems, domestic life and kinships, dress, amusements, religion, learning, mathematics, magic and folk beliefs, literature, art, agriculture, trades, arts and crafts, commerce, warfare, and much else. His objective point of view, eschewing romanticism on the one hand and frigid pedantry on the other, gives us a treatment that is as trustworthy in fact as it is evocative in effect — as Professor Jon Manchip White says in his new introduction for this edition, “From first to last … a superb performance.” The scholar, the student and the merely curious can do no better than to go to this first, great authority on ancient Egypt. Profusely illustrated throughout."

212,"A decade after he published his famous first novel, A Long and Happy Life, Reynolds Price began a serious study of the Hebrew and Greek narratives which combine to form that crucial document of Western civilization we call the Bible. Since early childhood, Price had known Bible stories of patriarchs, kings, prophets, and the boldly assertive women of Ancient Israel, as well as the four-fold gospel story of the life of Jesus -- another Jew whose career has exerted immense fascination on subsequent history.  In Price's early middle age, however, he felt compelled to go further than simple reading; he began to investigate the rudiments of the Bible stories as deeply as possible. He focused on the Hebrew and Greek originals that are unquestionably the most discussed and annotated texts with the close assistance of other literal versions and of numerous scholarly commentaries, old and modern. He was likewise encouraged and helped by frequent discussions with distinguished scholar-colleagues at Duke University, where he has taught since 1958.  As the work continued over several years, Price expanded his translation attempts into the Greek New Testament. And soon he had begun an informal navigation of the shoals of Koine Greek -- that common Mediterranean dialect in which a good deal of the business of the Roman empire was conducted and in which the gospels and all other books of the New Testament were written. Gradually, his translations of separate incidents from the four gospels evolved into a literal translation of the whole of the oldest gospel, Mark. His first version of Mark appeared, along with other translations from the Old and New Testaments, in A Palpable God (Atheneum, 1978). The book met with a wide and favorable reception from scholars, writers, and critics.  Price's studies have expanded steadily in the intervening decades; and in recent years he has worked at both a revised version of his early translation of Mark and an entirely new literal version of the Gospel of John (John is the lastpublished gospel and almost surely the one that comes, at its core, from an eyewitness of the life of Jesus). To his new translations, Price has added extensive prefaces, which he hopes will be of interest to scholars and casual readers alike. The prefaces are the result not only of his own work as a translator and his discussions with New Testament scholars of more than twenty years reading in textual exegesis, in the life of the first-century Roman world (including the immensely complicated realities of Roman Palestine), but also in consideration of thewidespread and ongoing attempt to reconsider the historical bases of our knowledge of Jesus.  Finally, after twice teaching a semester-long seminar on the gospels of Mark and John at Duke University, Price has written a gospel of his own. The new gospel, which he calls ""apocryphal"" in a non-canonical sense, makes a fresh attempt at a compact narrative of the life and work of Jesus. Yet it is an attempt grounded meticulously in the earliest available historic, biographical, and theological evidence. In a third and final preface, Price describes the motive for writing a gospel of his own. In brief, his new gospel (like the whole of Three Gospels) aims to render the highest possible contemporaryjustice to a life lived two thousand years ago, a life presented in -- and, to a startling extent, still recoverable from -- documents that have proved the most influential in Western history."

221,"""For most of us, money is never just money,"" writes Olivia Mellan. It can also represent love, power, happiness, security, self-esteem, and so much more. As a result, we have intense feelings about money - feelings we often hide from - which prevent us from dealing with it productively, and which make it a primary source of anxiety and conflict in our lives and relationships.Olivia Mellan knows how to help individuals and couples resolve their money conflicts. In Money Harmony, she presents the innovative program she has successfully used for more than a decade in her private practice and in workshops and seminars nationwide. Her reassuring, positive approach gives readers insight through real-life examples and conversations and self-knowledge exercises; teaches readers how to evaluate the impact of childhood experiences on their current money attitudes and behaviors; demystifies the common myths about money that can lead to extreme actions, running the gamut from overspending to avoidance to hoarding; and explains the strengths and weaknesses of various money personality styles, allowing readers to come to terms, comfortably, with their own styles.The second half of Money Harmony is devoted to couples, whose hidden money agendas and often opposing styles can cause conflict. Mellan offers a variety of proven communication techniques: dynamic activities and creative ""moneytalks"" that teach couples how to appreciate and respect differing styles, to resolve simple and complex money conflicts, and to set individual and joint goals. For anyone whose life or relationship is affected by money, Money Harmony is essential reading."
222,"In 1990, IBM had its most profitable year ever. By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction -- victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, ""The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.""Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won conclusions about the essence of what makes a great company run.In the history of modern business, many companies have gone from being industry leaders to the verge of extinction. Through the heroic efforts of a new management team, some of those companies have even succeeded in resuscitating themselves and living on in the shadow of their former stature. But only one company has been at the pinnacle of an industry, fallen to near collapse, and then, beyond anyone's expectations, returned to set the agenda. That company is IBM.Lou Gerstener, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 to March 2002, when he retired as CEO. He remained chairman of the board through the end of 2002. Before joining IBM, Mr. Gerstner served for four years as chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, Inc. This was preceded by an eleven-year career at the American Express Company, where he was president of the parent company and chairman and CEO of its largest subsidiary. Prior to that, Mr. Gerstner was a director of the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Co., Inc. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard Business School."

224,"From the Preface:The fact that so much of modern art has devoted itself to the exploration and assertion of its own identity is reflected in, but does not explain, the increasing amount of writing and talking on the part of contemporary artists. Rather, the whole history of the changing role of art and artists in a democratic, industrial, and technological society stands behind the spate of artists' words and the public's hunger for them?even some of the general public out there beyond art's little circle. Statements by artists appeal somewhat the way drawings do: they bring us, or at least they hold the promise of bringing us, closer to the artist's thoughts and feelings and to an understanding of his or her modus operandi; they hold the keys to a mysterious realm. And sometimes they offer us the sheer pleasure of good reading. Such is the primary raison d'?e of this book.Its other motivation is educational, and stems from the frustrating lack, in teaching contemporary art, of any single compilation of statements by American artists from 1940 to the present.? This anthology differs in several respects from those others that do include documents of American art since 1940.? The selection I have made is devoted exclusively to statements of artists; it is limited to the last four decades; it presents in a single volume a representative and fairly comprehensive coverage of major developments in American art beginning with Abstract Expressionism; and, whenever possible, it cities the first, or among the very earliest, documents signalizing a shift in the definition, intent, or direction of art.?"

In The Fairy's Mistake, two very different sisters have two very different encounters with the fairy Ethelinda. Rosella is kind and helpful. Her reward: Jewels and gems tumble out of her mouth whenever she speaks. Myrtle is rude and spiteful. Her punishment: Bugs and vipers slither out of her mouth. The fairy Ethelinda feels she's meted out justice just right--until she discovers Rosella has been locked up by a greedy prince and Myrtle is having the time of her life!  In The Princess Test, King Humphrey has decided its time for his son, Prince Nicholas, to marry. But he must make sure the bride is a real princess. So he devises a series of princess tests, designed to weed out the phonies and the fakes. Meanwhile, Nicholas has fallen in love with Lorelei, a mere blacksmith's daughter. She's no princess, but he wants to marry her all the same--but how will she ever pass the terrible tests?In these first two delightfully entertaining, laugh-out-loud Princess Tales, Gail Levine gently spoofs the notion that fairies are always right and that tests can never prove a persons worth, but holds fast to the notion that true love will always win in the end."

250,"THE BRILLIANT AND CONTROVERSIAL CRITIQUE OF AMERICAN CULTURE WITH NEARLY A MILLION COPIES IN PRINT  In 1987, eminent political philosopher Allan Bloom published The Closing of the American Mind, an appraisal of contemporary America that “hits with the approximate force and effect of electroshock therapy” (The New York Times) and has not only been vindicated, but has also become more urgent today. In clear, spirited prose, Bloom argues that the social and political crises of contemporary America are part of a larger intellectual crisis: the result of a dangerous narrowing of curiosity and exploration by the university elites. Now, in this twenty-fifth anniversary edition, acclaimed author and journalist Andrew Ferguson contributes a new essay that describes why Bloom’s argument caused such a furor at publication and why our culture so deeply resists its truths today."

254,"John Calvin Batchelor's ""Ain't You Glad You Joined the Republicans?"" (Abraham Lincoln's 1860 campaign slogan) is the truth, and nothing but the unbelievable truth, of the Grand Old Party of the Republic. Born in the cataclysm of the antislavery movement, the Republican Party was from the first - and remains today - the most successful revolutionary party in the history of democracy. And the Party's story - from Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt to Nixon, Reagan, and Gingrich - is the pageant of American politics.Using primary sources long overlooked by traditional historians and employing a novelist's eye and ear for the telling detail, Batchelor, in his sweeping narrative, encompasses one and a half centuries of Republican battle and paradox."
255,"Nine out of ten Americans own a Bible, but how much do they know about the one book that has influenced human history more than any other? Don't Know Much About the Bible by New York Times bestselling author Kenneth C. Davis is designed to illuminate everything we need to know about the Good Book but never learned.With wit, authority, and intelligence, Davis brings the world of the Old and New Testaments to vivid life, setting the panorama of the Scriptures against the historical events that shaped them; clearing up misconceptions and mistranslations; summarizing Bible stories, parables, and miracles; and adding fresh new insights to the world's most owned, least understood book.Davis is uniquely qualified for the assignment. The creator of the bestselling Don't Know Much About series, which has more than 1.6 million copies in print, he now illuminates the bestselling book of all time using his inimitable question-and-answer approach and providing a key to the people, places, and ""household names"" we need to unlock ""The Greatest Story Ever Told.""Relying on up-to-date research and improved translations, Davis set out to uncover what the Bible says -- and doesn't say. Don't Know Much About the Bible is the result of his efforts and includes the following observations: There are two different Creation stories told in Genesis, but no apple in the Garden of Eden story. Noah invented wine and cursed the son who had seen him drunk and naked. There was no ""coat of many colors"" in the story of Joseph and his jealous brothers, but rather a long-sleeved robe. Moses didn't write the Torah and he didn't part the Red Sea in his escape from Pharaoh. The Sixth Commandment does not condemn all killing. Jericho's walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. King David probably didn't kill Goliath and didn't write the Psalms."

And eat all the fiber-rich foods you can shove down your throat; these would be mainly your cotton candy and your Slim Jims.Barry on junk foodsWhite bread and refined sugar, if eaten, cause death within hours.

258,"In this important study Ernst Cassirer analyzes the non-rational thought processes that go to make up culture. He demonstrates that beneath both language and myth there lies an unconscious ""grammar"" of experience, whose categories and canons are not those of logical thought. He shows that this prelogical ""logic"" is not merely an undeveloped state of rationality, but something basically different, and that this archaic mode of thought still has enormous power over even our most rigorous thought, in language, poetry and myth.The author analyzes brilliantly such seemingly diverse (yet related) phenomena as the metaphysics of the Bhagavat Gita, the Melanesian concept of Mana, the Naturphilosophie of Schelling, modern poetry, Ancient Egyptian religion, and symbolic logic. He covers a vast range of material that is all too often neglected in studies of human thought.These six essays are of great interest to the student of philosophy or the philosophy of science, the historian, or the anthropologist. They are also remarkably timely for students of literature, what with the enormous emphasis placed upon ""myth"" in modern literary speculation. This book is not superficial speculation by a dabbler, but a penetrating study by one of the most profound and sensitive philosophic minds of our time."

262,"Tom Chapman's reporting begins innocently enough. It's the eve of the one and only presidential debate, and he's been sent to Colonial Williamsburg by his magazine, The New American Tatler, to cover the event. An important assignment, but pretty routine for a journalist of Chapman's abilities.The campaign itself, however, has been anything but routine. The American people face an impossible choice between apparent evil and apparent incompetence: The Republican candidate, David Donald Meredith, a handsome, charismatic figure and a riveting speaker, is a fundamentalist demagogue, a nativist, and probably a racist - none but the most fervent ideologues doubts that his election would tear the country apart. The Democrat, Paul L. Greene, is everything Meredith is not - liberal, earnest, and utterly colorless - and is so far behind in the polls that he has all but conceded the race weeks before the election.As the handlers, the press corps, the camera crews, and the campaign operators assemble in Williamsburg for the final battle of the campaign, a different sort of battle is taking place on the debate panel. Reporters have been given devastating anonymous reports about Meredith's personal life. There's no time to check them out, but using them could throw the election to Greene. In utter secrecy, a decision is made. By the time the debate is over, American politics and journalism have been changed forever and the four panelists have vaulted to mega-stardom. And Tom Chapman is hot on the trail of the biggest story of his career: the debate behind the last debate."

266,"""The jet fighter is one of the great icons of the second half of the twentieth century, a symbol of achievement, of technical excellence, of ultimate modernity, of latent military power.""  So begins Ivan Rendall, a former Royal Air Force pilot, in this thrilling first-ever history of the most seductive and deadly of all of man's weapons of war. From its birth in battle during the last days of World War II to its current aeronautical peak, the jet fighter has always been the king of the sky. Rendall's Rolling Thunder is the celebration of a machine, and a culture, for which ""winning is about accepting that there is no such thing as second-best.""  Rendall's scrupulous history is driven by a strong thesis: jets may depend upon technological advances, but the human edge supplied by their pilots has determined their success or failure in all times and places. In this respect, the West has triumphed over its enemies. Beginning with the dangerously fast but hopelessly outnumbered German Me 262, jets and the men who flew them quickly became potent physical and psychological weapons. From the ruins of a defeated Germany came the now-familiar look of swept-back wings and with them the secret of supersonic flight. Less than a decade later, the two World War II allies most responsible for Germany's defeat would meet as enemies in Korea. Their planes -- the American F-86 Saber and Russian MiG-15 -- clashed over the Yalu River in what American pilots called ""MiG Alley."" Diving from 40,000 feet and flying through dry riverbeds so low that their engines kicked up dirt, both sides' machines soon proved their worth.  In Vietnam, American fighter pilots involved in the costly ""Rolling Thunder"" campaign again proved the value of the American emphasis on individualism as taught in the ""Top Gun"" school of aeronautics. Rendall vividly describes pilots in F-4 Phantoms and F-105 Thunderchiefs dodging SA-2 surface-to-air missiles in the ""ultimate test of man versus machine.""  Recent uses of air power, from the legendary ""Instant Thunder"" campaign in the Gulf War to the enforcement of No-Fly Zones in Bosnia, have proved that the jet fighter remains as versatile and dangerous as ever. But today, with $100 million mach 3 machines capable of climbing 65,000 feet -- twice the height of Everest -- in a minute, many have argued that the pilot has become the weak link in the jet fighter's lethal equation. Rendall shows that the argument to remove the pilot from his machine -- seemingly complete with NASA's new unmanned X-36 -- is as old as the machine that broke the sound barrier, Chuck Yeager's X-1. The ability to balance the grace and brutality of a machine that has evolved into a perfect combination of form and function will remain the unique province of the fighter pilot -- the ""quintessential warrior of our times."""

Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean puts back together the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy.Young Men and Fire won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.""A magnificent drama of writing, a tragedy that pays tribute to the dead and offers rescue to the living.... Maclean's search for the truth, which becomes an exploration of his own mortality, is more compelling even than his journey into the heart of the fire. His description of the conflagration terrifies, but it is his battle with words, his effort to turn the story of the 13 men into tragedy that makes this book a classic.""—from New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice, Best Books of 1992""A treasure: part detective story, part western, part tragedy, part elegy and wholly eloquent ghost story in which the dead and the living join ranks cheerfully, if sometimes eerily, in a search for truth and the rest it brings.""—Joseph Coates, Chicago Tribune""An astonishing book. In compelling language, both homely and elegant, Young Men and Fire miraculously combines a fascinating primer on fires and firefighting, a powerful, breathtakingly real reconstruction of a tragedy, and a meditation on writing, grief and human character.... Maclean's last book will stir your heart and haunt your memory.""—Timothy Foote, USA Today""Beautiful.... A dark American idyll of which the language can be proud.""—Robert M. Adams, The New York Review of Books""Young Men and Fire is redolent of Melville.

His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world—political, social, and cultural—as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left—the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack—by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic issues like taxation, education, patriotism, and the family have been exploited by liberals with their own agendas—with potentially disastrous results.Filled with the commonsense commentary and passionate argument that have made Sean Hannity the most compelling conservative voice since Rush Limbaugh, Let Freedom Ring is an urgent call to arms. For, as Hannity warns, ""We are engaged in a war of ideas. And civilization is at stake."""

While the aspiring politician Callicles propounds the view that might is right, and the rhetorician Gorgias argues that oratory and the power to persuade represent 'the greatest good', Socrates insists on the duty of politicians to consider the welfare of their citizens - a duty he believed had been dishonoured in the Athens of his time.

284,"Although it is customary to credit Freud's self-analysis, it may be more accurate, Alexander Welsh argues, to say that psychoanalysis began when The Interpretation of Dreams was published in the last weeks of the nineteenth century. Only by going public with his theory--that dreams manifest hidden wishes--did Freud establish a position to defend and embark upon a career. That position and career have been among the most influential in this century. In August 1899, Freud wrote to Wilhelm Fliess of the dream book in terms reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. Beginning from a dark wood, this modern journey features ""a concealed pass though which I lead the reader--my specimen dream with its peculiarities, details, indiscretions, bad jokes--and then suddenly the high ground and the view and the question, Which way do you wish to go now?"" Physician that he is, Freud appoints himself guide rather than hero, yet the way ""you"" wish to go is very much his prescribed way. In Welsh's book, readers are invited on Freud's journey, to pause at each concealed pass in his seminal work and ask where the guide is taking them and why. Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. ""Some of the humor throughout,"" Welsh notes, ""can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance.""

289,"On September 11, 2001, the world in which we live was changed forever. The twin towers of the World Trade Center came crashing down, one side of the Pentagon burst into flame, and more than six thousand men, women, and children lost their lives in the most deadly terrorist attack on American soil. As shocking as it was, it had been long in the making: The assault was the most sophisticated and horrifying in a series of operations masterminded by Osama bin Laden and his Jihad group -- an organization that CNN's terrorism analyst Peter Bergen calls Holy War, Inc.  One of only a handful of Western journalists to have interviewed the world's most wanted man face to face, Peter Bergen has produced the definitive book on the Jihadist network that operates globally and in secrecy. In the course of four years of investigative reporting, he has interviewed scores of insiders -- from bin Laden associates and family members to Taliban leaders to CIA officials -- and traveled to Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom to learn the truth about bin Laden's al Queda organization and his mission.  Immense in scope and unnerving in its findings, Holy War, Inc. reveals:   How bin Laden lives, travels, and communicates with his ""cells."" How his role in the crushing defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan made him a hero to Muslims all over the world -- and equipped him to endure a long and bloody siege. How the CIA ended up funding -- to the tune of three billion dollars -- radical, anti-American Afghan groups allied to bin Laden. How the attacks that foreshadowed the destruction of the World Trade Center -- among them the bombings of the American embassies in Africa and the warship USS Cole in Yemen -- were planned and executed. The dimensions of bin Laden's personal fortune, and why freezing his assets is both futile and nearly impossible. The ideology of bin Laden's number two, the man who has influenced him most profoundly in his holy war -- the Egyptian Ayman al Zawahiri. What we can expect from Islamist extremists in the future.   Above all, Peter Bergen helps us to see bin Laden's organization in a radically new light: as a veritable corporation that has exploited twenty-first-century communications and weapons technologies in the service of a medieval reading of the Koran and holy war. Holy War, Inc. is essential reading for anyone trying to understand tomorrow's terrorist threats and the militant Islamist movements that could determine the fate of governments -- and human lives -- the world over.  Both author and publisher will donate a portion of the proceeds from this book to United Way's September 11th Fund for the relief of victims of the World Trade Center attacks."

296,"In 1999, John McCain wrote one of the most acclaimed and bestselling memoirs of the decade, Faith of My Fathers. That book ended in 1972, with McCain’s release from imprisonment in Vietnam. This is the rest of his story, about his great American journey from the U.S. Navy to his electrifying run for the presidency, interwoven with heartfelt portraits of the mavericks who have inspired him through the years—Ted Williams, Theodore Roosevelt, visionary aviation proponent Billy Mitchell, Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata!, and, most indelibly, Robert Jordan. It was Jordan, Hemingway’s protagonist in For Whom the Bell Tolls, who showed McCain the ideals of heroism and sacrifice, stoicism and redemption, and why certain causes, despite the costs, are . . .Worth the Fighting ForAfter five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, naval aviator John McCain returned home a changed man. Regaining his health and flight-eligibility status, he resumed his military career, commanding carrier pilots and serving as the navy’s liaison to what is sometimes ironically called the world’s most exclusive club, the United States Senate. Accompanying Senators John Tower and Henry “Scoop” Jackson on international trips, McCain began his political education in the company of two masters, leaders whose standards he would strive to maintain upon his election to the U.S. Congress. There, he learned valuable lessons in cooperation from a good-humored congressman from the other party, Morris Udall. In 1986, McCain was elected to the U.S. Senate, inheriting the seat of another role model, Barry Goldwater.During his time in public office, McCain has seen acts of principle and acts of craven self-interest. He describes both ex-tremes in these pages, with his characteristic straight talk and humor. He writes honestly of the lowest point in his career, the Keating Five savings and loan debacle, as well as his triumphant moments—his return to Vietnam and his efforts to normalize relations between the U.S. and Vietnamese governments; his fight for campaign finance reform; and his galvanizing bid for the presidency in 2000.Writes McCain: “A rebel without a cause is just a punk. Whatever you’re called—rebel, unorthodox, nonconformist, radical—it’s all self-indulgence without a good cause to give your life meaning.” This is the story of McCain’s causes, the people who made him do it, and the meaning he found. Worth the Fighting For reminds us of what’s best in America, and in ourselves."

Brick listens to their games on the radio in Windy Hill, in upstate New York, where his family has an apple orchard; Mariel, once a polio patient in the hospital in Windy Hill, lives in Brooklyn near the Dodgers’ home, Ebbets Field.

They send him to live in Brooklyn with their friend Loretta, even though Brick knows that their elderly neighbors need his help to pick what’s left of the apples.

The liberal bias continued.Now, breaking ranks and naming names, he reveals a corporate news culture in which the closed-mindedness is breathtaking and in which entertainment wins over hard news every time."
304,"Twenty years ago, while walking through a men's clothing store in"" Sag Harbor, New York, Sue Bender found herself drawn to an array of old Amish quilts that served as a background to a display of tweeds. She was immediately struck by their deep, saturated colors, the geometric simplicity of their design, and their quiet power. ""They spoke directly to me,"" she writes. ""They knew something.They went straight to my heart."" That was the beginning of her ""journey of the spirit.""Plain and Simple, illustrated with the author's own drawings, is the gentle, eloquent story of that journey. Bender, a wife, a mother, and a dedicated artist from Berkeley, California, sought out Amish families that would allow her-one of the outsiders the Amish call the ""English""-- to visit and share in their daily fives.In language as spare and vivid as Amish art, Bender recounts her venture into an entirely different world, the seemingly timeless world of the Amish, a landscape of immense inner quiet. With an inquiring eye, she describes the months she spent in Iowa and Ohio with two Amish families. She illuminates the everyday rhythms of their world and conveys the life of the people who taught her about simplicity, commitment, and the joy of doing what you do well.In nine chapters, as interrelated and well-crafted as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt, Bender speaks to the seeker in us all and reveals how she was drawn to -- and changed by -- the Amish values of austerity, humility, and the ordinary. ""How"" they live reflects what they believe"" she writes. ""Their life is their art!""After living and working with these people whose values were so unlike her own, Bender was able to return home and rework her ""crazy quilt"" life into a new pattern. ""I thought I was going to learn more about their quilts,"" she writes, ""but the quilts were only guides, leading me to what I really needed to learn, to answer a question I hadn't yet formed: ""Is there another way to lead a good life?"""

315,"From Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator, to C-3PO of the Star Wars trilogy, to the comic robot-butler in Woody Allen's Sleeper, the ""android"" has long been a familiar figure on the American imaginative landscape. But how far removed from reality are such fictitious creations? Will there ever be an intelligent robot in our future? Neural networks expert Maureen Caudill says yes. In fact, she argues that the development of intelligent androids is a mere twenty years away.    In Our Own Image reveals just how far we've come in developing an intelligent robot, describes what technical obstacles must still be cleared, and--perhaps most interesting of all--outlines the potentially massive social disruptions and tangled moral and legal dilemmas these ""human machines"" will cause. In a sweeping look at state-of-the-art breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer science, psychology, and neural networks, Caudill shows how these fields have advanced machine vision, language recognition, problem solving, memory, and other requisites of intelligent robots. She describes foot-long mechanical ants that can follow you around a room, robots that can crack eggs, shear sheep, play ping-pong, tighten wing-nuts, and other feats of dexterity. (One robot, WABOT-2, developed in Japan, can read simple sheet music and played the electric organ with the NHK Symphony Orchestra of Japan.) electric organ.) And she concludes that as our ability to make faster, smaller, cheaper computers blends with our ability to mimic the behavior of the human mind, the first truly intelligent machines come closer to fruition. But once an android has been perfected, Caudill warns, there will likely be some unexpected--and perhaps unpleasant--social changes. Androids may compete with human workers for jobs--and robots won't take vacations, won't have family problems, and might never leave the firm. Androids may also entangle our legal system in complex, difficult questions: Can an individual own an intelligent android? What rights should it have in society? Does ownership of an android imply the right to turn it off--the right to ""kill"" it? And does such ownership brand us as slaveholders?    The existence of intelligent androids will provoke these and other questions. Caudill concludes that we will soon be forced to come up with answers if we are to learn to share the world with another intelligent species--one of our own creation."

326,"Brimming with optimism, John Frohnmayer journeyed to Washington, D.C., in 1989 to serve a cause he believed in deeply: the arts in America. Appointed by President Bush to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, he was abruptly fired two and a half years later in a storm of front-page controversy.Leaving Town Alive is Frohnmayer's lively and startlingly candid account of his trial by fire in the brutal world of power politics. Taking over the NEA amid the uproar about Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, Frohnmayer stood at the center of the emotional debate over public funding for the arts. On the left were staunch defenders of free speech and the artists whose confrontational works came under attack. On the right were Jesse Helms and the fundamentalist proponents of traditional values.At first Frohnmayer assumed that he could negotiate anything and that everyone had the best interests of the country at heart. He was wrong: the White House, for instance, just wanted the problem of ""offensive art"" to go away, while right-wing fund-raisers wanted to keep the issue alive as long as possible. In the end, Frohnmayer's harrowing education changed him. He entered the fray a First Amendment moderate; he emerged a free-speech radical.John Frohnmayer had an insider's view of Washington during the Bush years, and he writes with remarkable frankness about the bitter battles over the government's involvement in the arts. Passionate, witty, and wonderfully readable, Leaving Town Alive is, finally, an eloquent plea for the liberation of American culture from the narrow concerns of partisan politics."

328,"It could be you or someone you love. Strong, silent types are everywhere, and it is their telltale silence that has kept their problems hidden until now. A silent son can come from a family that coped with violence, alcoholism, child abuse, extreme rigidity, or divorce, but all silent sons have certain common characteristics:   They keep things that bother them to themselves.  They deny that unpleasant events occur.  They fear letting people know them.  They have difficulty interacting with their parents, spouses, or children.  They have a strong fear of criticism.  They are often angry.   In Silent Sons, Dr. Robert Ackerman, a silent son himself, examines the problems that commonly confront silent sons, keeping them from experiencing the full range of human emotions. In a compassionate and hopeful voice, the author defines the silent son and examines the impact of parents, particularly fathers, on these men and shows how their dysfunctional upbringing affects their present relationships, especially with women.  By putting aside anger, finding peace with one's self, and looking for support from other silent sons, Dr. Ackerman feels every man can realize his full potential and become a well balanced, healthy survivor."

Christian Europe, a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory, first in the battlefield and the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of public and even private life.    In this intriguing volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed--how they had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy, education and culture. Lewis highlights the striking differences between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the 18th to the 20th centuries through thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil society, the clock and the calendar.   Hailed in The New York Times Book Review as ""the doyen of Middle Eastern studies,"" Bernard Lewis is one of the West's foremost authorities on Islamic history and culture. In this striking volume, he offers an incisive look at the historical relationship between the Middle East and Europe."

Though its pieces have breathtaking range, each involves discovery - of landscapes, thoughts, emotions.Hoagland takes us into the rainforest in Belize, the mountains of Yemen, the Okefenokee Swamp, and ""Up the Black to Chalkyitsik."" With equal passion, he guides us through treacherous terrain in probing essays about the literary world. Part memoir, part travel guide, these twenty-five essays, (all written with a good deal of urgency and fun) represent the work of a master at the top of his dazzling form."

340,"Not since Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting has an ambitious first novel created such a stir among readers of important new voices in fiction.  Since its release in the United Kingdom, Brass has sent shock waves through literary circles for its raw, unrelenting, poetic, and utterly compelling portrait of Millie, a promising college kid drifting into a deceptively inviting world of street culture, drug-induced adorations, and sexual hedonism.Helen Walsh, at the age of twenty-seven, has produced a staggeringly alive debut novel that portrays a generation of youth?those coming of age in the '80s and '90s?through the prism of Millie. Millie and her best friend, Jamie, have been through it all together. However, as Millie is lured away from what was a promising academic career toward a life of numbing drugs and increasingly deviant sexual encounters, Jamie is finally settling down with his girlfriend. Millie feels betrayed by one of the few authentic and nurturing relationships in her life, just as she discovers her own limitations and the more penetrating complexities of a family she thought she knew."
341,"Alan Dershowitz, one of the foremost legal thinkers of our time, explores a series of questions raised by the most watched criminal trial in American history. Through this brilliant, bold, and eye-opening account of the O.J. Simpson case, he exposes the realities of the criminal justice system of this country.Widely recognized as America's leading appellate attorney and by any measure a great lawyer. Dershowitz was the man chosen to prepare the appeal if Simpson had been convicted. Now Professor Dershowitz steps back from that role, not to defend the defense team, nor even to plead the case for his client's innocence. Instead, he uses the case to examine the larger issues and to identify the social forces - media, money, gender, and race - that shape the criminal justice system in America today."
342,"In a brilliant, wry, and provocative new book, National Book Award finalist Francine Prose explores the complex relationship between the artist and his muse. In so doing, she illuminates with great sensitivity and intelligence the elusive emotional wellsprings of the creative process.There is no ideal muse, but rather as many variations on the theme as there are individual women who have had the luck, or misfortune, to find their destiny conjoined with that of a particular artist. What are we to make of the relationship between the child Alice Liddell, who inspired Alice in Wonderland, and the Oxford don who became Lewis Carroll? Or the so-called serial muse, Lou Andreas-Salomé, who captivated Nietzsche, Rilke, and Freud—as impressive a list as any muse can boast? Salvador Dalí was the only artist to sign his art with his muse's name, and Gala Dalí certainly knew how to market her artist and his work while simultaneously burnishing her own image and celebrity.Lou, Gala, and Yoko Ono all defy the feminist stereotype of the muse as a passive beauty put on a pedestal and oppressed by a male artist. However, it's rare to find an artist and muse who are genuine partners, true collaborators, such as ballerina Suzanne Farrell and choreographer George Balanchine.What do the nine muses chosen by Francine Prose have in common? They were all beautiful, or sexy, or gifted with some more unconventional appeal. All loved, and were loved by, their artists, and inspired them with an intensity of emotion akin to Eros. For these artists, the love of—or for—their muses provided an essential element required for the melding of talent and technique necessary to create art."

346,"With American foreign policy playing an increasingly dominant role in world events of the past century, the international diplomatic community and even Americans themselves have staged heated debates centering on the charge that our government often misreads international crises.      Responding to the controversy, Robert Dallek's groundbreaking book argues that the pressures generated by unresolved political and social domestic problems have shaped American foreign policy. In an illuminating examination of each significant period--from the expansionism of the Spanish-American War and the American entrance into World War I, to American-Soviet relations during World War II, the Cold War period that followed, and American involvement in Korea and Vietnam--Dallek reveals why we have acted as we have, often in the face of logic and with costly consequences.       Providing a wealth of new insights, he presents American foreign policies in the twentieth century as symbolic extensions of domestic hopes and fears.  Reaching beyond traditional explanations of why and how these policies reflect U.S. concerns at home more than realities abroad, this important and provocative analysis challenges thinking Americans to confront the whole fascinating history of American foreign affairs in the twentieth century."
347,"Maddox presents a richly detailed and startlingly new portrait of D. H. Lawrence: not the bearded prophet with the baleful eye, not the sickly and self-absorbed sexual outlaw, but a vulnerable, sensitive Lawrence, a hilarious mimic, a lover of nature, an inspired teacher, a brilliant journalist, an ecological visionary, and above all - as he saw himself - a married man.The prize-winning author of Nora (Mrs. James Joyce) examines Lawrence's perplexing, restless life through the greatest contradiction in it - his marriage to Frieda, a woman even more defiant of conventional morality than he was. Theirs was a mismatch made in heaven, a marriage with infidelities on both sides, verbal taunts and physical abuse, separations, and the strains of Lawrence's long struggle with tuberculosis. Yet her determined influence on his life and work cannot be overestimated, and they remained together until his bitter, tragic death."

350,"In Ashes of Glory, Ernest B. Furgurson conjures up wartime Richmond in vivid detail. We meet not only with such luminaries as Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson but with a strikingly broad spectrum of the community: preachers, nurses, newspapermen, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, slaves, slave dealers, bootleggers, actors, spies, prostitutes, prisoners of war, refugees, handsome widows, eager debutantes, and swarms of enlisted men and officers from all over the South.Furgurson ushers us into the legendary Spotswood Hotel, where generals and gentry communed amid gossip and bourbon. He admits us to the hospitals crammed with amputees and infested by rats. He plunges us into a bread riot involving several hundred citizens and spurred by a ""woman huckster."" He shows us that, despite universal hardship, Richmond fairly crackled with spirit: theater manager John Hill Hewitt kept melodrama flowing on the city's popular stages; taffy parties, faro parlors, and sewing circles kept various other constituencies entertained; Colonel Thomas E. Rose of Pennsylvania and dozens more tunneled out of notorious Libby Prison; the genteel Union sympathizer Elizabeth Van Lew conducted an elaborate and extraordinarily successful campaign of espionage. Meanwhile, beneath the surface, a compound of defiance, despair, and paranoia preyed on the nerves of everyone from President Davis on down, turning a stunned and battered, once-glamorous society virtually inside out."

With her earthy sensibility and sharp sense of humor, the author shows this world in a light devoid of preciousness—while expressing with heart the integrity of the spiritual work being undertaken. We come away from our visit to this exotic realm having found it both extraordinary and surprisingly familiar. The neuroses, obsessions, and petty concerns exposed by Snow—both in herself and her fellow staff members—prove to be grist for the mill for discovering the grace inherent in life just as it is."

It is soon after the Civil War; Aimee lives alone, but is graced with visits from two friends, a crippled man and a troubled eleven-year-old girl. She is perpetually caught between the sensual world she so desires and the divine retribution passed down to her by her mother's scorn.

359,"A stunning novel about family secrets, hailed nationwide as a masterpiece. Ram Karan, a corrupt official in the New Delhi school system, lives in one of the city's slums with his widowed daughter and his little granddaughter. Bumbling, sad, ironic, Ram is also a man corroded by a terrible secret. With the assassination of the politician Rajiv Gandhi, Ram is plunged into a series of escalating and possibly deadly political betrayals. As he tries to save his family, his daughter reveals a crime he had hoped was long buried-and Ram, struggling to survive, must make amends after a life of deception.

360,"Stella Parrish is seventeen, attractive, smart, deeply alienated, and unable to countenance life's absurdities. She is not nihilistic; she is prematurely exhausted. Since her parents OD'd on designer drugs when she was eleven, she has lived with well-meaning but inexperienced foster parents, while her grandfather, her only living relative, tries ever more ingenious ways of committing suicide in his retirement home. Here are the last two weeks of Stella's senior year in Orange County, California: the intensive AP final exams; the childish, celebratory trips; the totemic importance attached to graduation. Beneath Stella's mordantly funny take on her life is the decisiveness with which she disengages from it, planting clues and providing explanations for those who will try to understand the act she is about to commit. With perfect pitch, remarkable wit, and a spare, vivid prose, Stella turns her farewell to suburbia into a wry philosophical inquiry."

363,"David Grossman, the leading Israeli novelist of his generation, showed himself in his internationally acclaimed novel, See Under: LOVE, to be a consummate artist of the inner life of the child. Now, in his most moving and accessible novel yet, he gives us the story of the greatest and most universal tragedy, the loss of that childhood world. At twelve, Aron Kleinfeld is the ringleader among the boys in his Jerusalem neighborhood, their inspiration in dreaming up games and adventures. But as his friends begin to mature, Aron remains imprisoned for three long years in the body of a child. While Israel inches toward the Six-Day War, and while the voices of his friends change and become strange to him, Aron lives in his child body as though in a nightmare. Like a spy in enemy territory, he learns to decipher the internal codes of sexuality and desire, to understand the unyielding bureaucracy of the human body. Hurled between childhood and adulthood, between the pure and the profane, he is like a volcano of emotions and impulses. But, like his hero Houdini, Aron still struggles to escape from the trap of growing up.The Book of Intimate Grammar is about the alchemy of childhood, which transforms loneliness and fear into creation, and about the struggle to emerge as an artist. Funny, painful and passionate, it is a work of enormous intensity and beauty."

365,"By the year 2000, the USDA predicts that 15 percent-8 million-of our children will be on their way to using Ritalin. In this illuminating investigation of the epidemic of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) today and its most widely prescribed treatment, the powerful psychostimulant Ritalin, psychologist Richard DeGrandpre sounds a warning: we may well be failing our children by treating symptoms and not causes with a quick-fix and ultimately unsatisfactory solution. Drawing on the latest findings from developmental, psychobiological, and social scientific research, DeGrandpre seeks to solve the problem of ADD by ""solving"" its history. He attributes the disturbing prevalence of inattention and hyperactivity in children to the larger societal consequences of a speed-up culture that has profoundly altered our perceptual expectations, our very experience of time, and our ability to defer gratification. Our society-wide rush to more, and faster, stimulation leaves children especially vulnerable to ""sensory addictions."" Ritalin Nation both exposes the shortsightedness of mere biological explanations of ADD and offers some practical guidelines for charting a more hopeful future in environments that deliberately ""make time for time,"" cultivate a less hurried existence, and promote a saner, safer community for our children."
366,"No book before this one has rendered the story of cigarettes -- mankind's most common self-destructive instrument and its most profitable consumer product -- with such sweep and enlivening detail.Here for the first time, in a story full of the complexities and contradictions of human nature, all the strands of the historical process -- financial, social, psychological, medical, political, and legal -- are woven together in a riveting narrative. The key characters are the top corporate executives, public health investigators, and antismoking activists who have clashed ever more stridently as Americans debate whether smoking should be closely regulated as a major health menace.We see tobacco spread rapidly from its aboriginal sources in the New World 500 years ago, as it becomes increasingly viewed by some as sinful and some as alluring, and by government as a windfall source of tax revenue. With the arrival of the cigarette in the late-nineteenth century, smoking changes from a luxury and occasional pastime to an everyday -- to some, indispensable -- habit, aided markedly by the exuberance of the tobacco huskers.This free-enterprise success saga grows shadowed, from the middle of this century, as science begins to understand the cigarette's toxicity. Ironically the more detailed and persuasive the findings by medical investigators, the more cigarette makers prosper by seeming to modify their product with filters and reduced dosages of tar and nicotine.We see the tobacco manufacturers come under intensifying assault as a rogue industry for knowingly and callously plying their hazardous wares while insisting that the health charges against them (a) remain unproven, and (b) are universally understood, so smokers indulge at their own risk.Among the eye-opening disclosures here: outrageous pseudo-scientific claims made for cigarettes throughout the '30s and '40s, and the story of how the tobacco industry and the National Cancer Institute spent millions to develop a ""safer"" cigarette that was never brought to market.Dealing with an emotional subject that has generated more heat than light, this book is a dispassionate tour de force that examines the nature of the companies' culpability, the complicity of society as a whole, and the shaky moral ground claimed by smokers who are now demanding recompense."

During his long, astonishing life, he has succeeded at everything he attempted. College football letterman. Heroic lifeguard. Sports announcer. Movie star. Television host. Corporate spokesman. Governor. And finally, the greatest dream of all: President of the United States.Fully two-thirds of the images in this book have never been published before, and they offer us glimpses into the private man as well as the public icon. We see him as a little boy in his mother's Sunday-school class; welcoming home GIs with Bette Davis; helping his daughter prepare for a ballet recital, and celebrating the birth of his namesake with his wife Nancy. In a wonderful assortment of unseen images from his presidential library, we see every aspect of the President, from building a snowman with his grandson on the White House lawn to anguishing over the deaths of Marines in Beirut.No matter what one's politics, these images, and James Spada's evocative, balanced text, provide new insights into a man whose life embodies the promise of America."
373,"When Americans cast their ballots on November 7, 2000, no one expected that the outcome of the presidential election would still be in doubt more than a month later. For the first time ever, the race for America's highest office had ended in a dead heat, with but a few hundred votes in Florida separating Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush of Texas. The stage was set for an extraordinary drama of recounts, challenges, court cases - and hanging, swinging, and dimpled chads.Deadlock is the first comprehensive account of what really happened in the ""post-election"" of 2000, written and reported by the award-winning political staff of The Washington Post, America's premier newspaper for politics and elections. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with the key participants and offering details never before reported by any news organization, the Post staff has produced not just an original work of history-in-the-making, but a page-turner to rival the best political thrillers."
374,"The Pulitzer Prize–winning biography of Harry S. Truman, whose presidency included momentous events from the atomic bombing of Japan to the outbreak of the Cold War and the Korean War, told by America’s beloved and distinguished historian.The life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters—Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson—and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man—a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined—but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges. The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman’s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur. Drawing on newly discovered archival material and extensive interviews with Truman’s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary “man from Missouri” who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history."
375,"Classics stand the test of time, and Alistair Cooke’s history of America is a classic. Nearly three decades have passed since the original edition of America?based on journalist-historian Cooke’s extraordinarily popular thirteen-part television series?sold more than a million copies. Yet Cooke’s view of America’s dynamic past and its impact upon the always-changing present continues to provide striking insights into the singular character of a nation. Those thirty years since award-winning America first rose to the top of best-seller lists have themselves wrought further dramatic changes. Presidents have been impeached, economies have toppled, empires have collapsed, and towers have fallen. In light of such events, Cooke has written for this new edition a compelling introduction and final chapter that bring his story of America up to date with the wisdom of the inimitably grand old man of correspondents. And what a story this book tells. From the discovery of America by European explorers to modern times; from the fighters for independence to the pioneers who tamed the West; from the slaves who fled to freedom to the huddled masses that sought a new life in the New World. And through it all, Cooke describes the essential forces that make America work so vitally. Updated in light of the September 11th tragedy, this new edition is complimented with full-color illustrations throughout. ?The first and maybe the finest, tribute to the nation.”?Newsweek ?A panoramic book, traveling fast and high, and the view it gives of our land and its people is exhilarating.”?Atlantic Monthly"

380,"At the turn of the century the United States seemed poised to overtake its European rivals on all fronts; its many strengths were finally being recognized—the wealth of resources, the profusion of ideas and innovation, and the artistic talent of its citizens. American power was expanding and American writers—including Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Whitman—were acclaimed at home and abroad. England’s condescending air toward America had already become inappropriate. The United States had reached a new level of respectability in the world. In light of this favorable international climate, why then did some of America’s most talented young writers travel to London to become, as Henry Adams put it, ”improvised Europeans”?Few writers have been studied and analyzed as much as the quartet at the heart of this book. But Alex Zwerdling was perplexed by this shared and often overlooked aspect of their background: Why, at the dawn of the American century, did these writers choose to go ”back” to what was called ”the Old World”? And why would these brilliant thinkers include in some of their most acclaimed work material that is today reviled as offensive—anti-Semetic, racist, anti-feminist? What was happening in the United States that repelled them? In striving to answer these questions, Alex Zwerdling illuminates the lives and careers of Henry Adams, Henry James, T.S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound as never before.These men chose to live their lives abroad at a crucial point in American history, both domestically and internationally. The massive influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe began to whittle away the Anglo-Saxon majority. The end of slavery created a renewal of efforts to make true the Constitution’s claim to universal equality. Women’s confidence and authority grew as they fought for independence and their own rights. These developments, Zwerdling argues, were large factors in why these four writers fled. He examines their works and their lives in the context of the American scene they left, and also in the context of the British scene they left for. His brilliant cultural history uses personal correspondence, unprinted articles, and other previously unknown sources to unravel the historical forces that shaped these literary lions. Depicting their careers as a roller-coaster ride through alien territory, the book shows that they produced extraordinary work in the midst of perpetual friction, indifferece, and even active hostility."

388,"Voice Lessons is a book about writing from a woman with a remarkable story to tell and an utterly distinctive voice in which to tell it. Nancy Mairs's essays have been called ""triumphs... of will, style, candor, thought and even form"" (Los Angeles Times). She has won acclaim for her autobiographical writing on themes from living with depression to renewing a marriage, from sex to religion. In Voice Lessons, Mairs's subjects are literary, but as always her approach is personal, revealing, and inspiring. Mairs first shares her sharply drawn story on how ""finding a voice"" as an essayist transformed her life when she was a graduate student, wife, and mother in her late thirties. In a tribute to the liberating power of literature and feminist ideas, she shows how the words of other writers made possible a new career, a new life in difficult times. Voice Lessons goes on to explore other women's writing and to outline a singular kind of literary life. Always grounding her writing in personal experience, always making ideas concrete, Mairs gives us essays on writing and the body, the challenges of autobiography, the revelatory power of Virginia Woolf and Alice Walker, the literature of personal disaster, and the art of dealing with rejection.

390,"""The very rich are different from you and me,"" said F. Scott Fitzgerald.  How different?  Well, Ivana Trump so abhors footprints on the carpet that she has the rooms in her home freshly vacuumed before she enters them.  Christina Onassis used to have Diet Coke flown to her by private jet.  And the elite members of San Francisco's Union Pacific Club needn't worry about handling dirty money, since every coin the enters the institution is scoured by the kitchen staff.These are just a few of the hilariously outrageous facts and anecdotes that Jon Winokur has assembled in this eye-popping field guide to the habits of the equestrian class.  From the schlock of the Nouveau to the stinginess of Old Money, here are the follies and foibles of such plutocrats as William Vanderbilt and Leona Helmsley, Aristotle Onassis and Doris Duke.  You'll learn how the super-rich get, conserve and squander their fortunes; how they thwart tax collectors, buy legislative bodies (not to mention entire countries), and literally get away with murder.  Here are a few of the most delicious: * The Sultan of Brunei flew the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to London for his son's ninth birthday party at a cost of $1 million.* Asked why she was carried everywhere by a burly attendant, Barbara Hutton replied, ""Why should I walk when I can hire someone to do it for me?""* When the late Time Warner boss Steve Ross flew his wife and two other couples to Mexico one Christmas, the trip required two corporate planes: One for people and one for gifts.* Donald Trump's 727 had 24-karat-gold seat-belt buckles.* The teenage Doris Duke's limousine was equipped with a panic button she could push whenever a boy tried to kiss her."

392,"You'll never watch baseball the same way again. A timeless baseball classic and a must read for any fan worthy of the name, Nine Innings dissects a single baseball game played in June 1982 -- inning by inning, play by play. Daniel Okrent, a seasoned writer and lifelong fan, chose as his subject a Milwaukee Brewers<endash>Baltimore Orioles matchup, though it could have been any game, because, as Okrent reveals, the essence of baseball, no matter where or when it's played, has been and will always be the same. In this particular moment of baseball history you will discover myriad aspects of the sport that are crucial to its nature but so often invisible to the fans -- the hidden language of catchers' signals, the physiology of pitching, the balance sheet of a club owner, the gait of a player stepping up to the plate. With the purity of heart and unwavering attention to detail that characterize our national pastime, Okrent goes straight to the core of the world's greatest game. You'll never watch baseball the same way again."
393,"Many books have told the epic story of the black migration from the South, a migration that by the 1970s had all but stopped. Instead, one by one African Americans began returning to some of the least promising places, places the Department of Agriculture calls ""persistent poverty counties."" In Call to Home, Carol Stack tells us why.Here are the stories of people trading their apartments in the city for trailers, old cabins, or brick houses built along dusty Southern back roads. Some were pushed rather than drawn back by rootlessness, joblessness, and urban decay. Others, made stronger by the uncompromising demands of city life, came home determined to apply the hard lessons they'd learned up north to build new lives in the South. Still others returned to recover what they had lost. Children often were sent home first, either to be cared for or to help care for grandparents who never left.Call to Home is the story of hardships - of starting over, of poverty, of rural life - but is also the story of success, of how people determined to build real communities and to set things right helped to establish the right of black Americans to participate as full citizens in the American South."
394,"The Ordinary Seaman, the second novel from acclaimed writer Francisco Goldman is a lyrical and spellbinding story of hope, despair, and the promise of love. The ordinary seaman is Esteban, a 19-year-old veteran of the war in Nicaragua, who has come to America with 14 other men to form the crew of the Urus. Docked on a desolate Brooklyn pier, the Urus is a wreck, and the men, without the means to return home, become its prisoners. Esteban, haunted by the loss of his first love in the war, gradually works up the courage to escape the ship and start a new life in the city. His story and those of his shipmates come to life, illuminating the conflicts and triumphs of the human heart."
395,"In 1948 the column-writing Alsop brothers produced an article for the Saturday Evening Post, then the country's preeminent weekly magazine. Its title: ""Must America Save the World?"" Their answer was a resounding yes. Indeed, Joseph and Stewart Alsop were there in those heady postwar years when the country's foreign-policy elite created what became known as the American Century. As men of words, they served as confidants of and cheerleaders for the men of deeds, who came largely from the country's patrician class.The Alsop brothers were themselves sons of this class. Theodore Roosevelt was the brothers' great-uncle. Eleanor Roosevelt was their mother's first cousin. They grew up with members of this Anglo-Saxon elite, went to school with them, socialized with them. And they threw the considerable weight of their column behind the efforts of these statesmen to refashion the world. Writing four times a week, they appeared in nearly two hundred newspapers; their work also graced the pages of the major magazines of the time. Thus, they wielded immense influence throughout the nation from the victory in World War II to the defeat in Vietnam.Stewart was a political analyst of rare acumen, while Joe, his older brother, was a curmudgeon with an aristocratic bearing and a biting wit. He once likened a dinner at Lyndon Johnson's to ""going to an opera in which one man sings all the parts."" He was a friend and confidant of John Kennedy, a teacher of Washington ways to Jackie Kennedy. When he called people in the highest echelons of officialdom, they responded.In Taking On the World, Robert W. Merry, a Washington insider himself, has fashioned an intricate and fascinating combination of biography and narrative history. As Mr. Merry puts it, ""Within the lifetime of the Alsop brothers the country was remade. And its remaking illuminates their careers, just as their careers illuminate the American Century."" Robert Merry casts brilliant light on these two remarkable men, and on one of the most tumultuous periods of the country's history."
396,"Why are individuals from the same family often no more similar in personality than those from different families? Why, within the same family, do some children conform to authority whereas others rebel? The family, it turns out, is not a ""shared environment"" but rather a set of niches that provide siblings with different outlooks.At the heart of this pioneering inquiry into human development is a fundamental insight: that the personalities of siblings vary because they adopt different strategies in the universal quest for parental favor. Frank J. Sulloway's most important finding is that eldest children identify with parents and authority, and support the status quo, whereas younger children rebel against it. Drawing on the work of Darwin and the new sciences of evolutionary psychology, he transforms our understanding of personality development and its origins in family dynamics.Most persuasively, Sulloway's findings offer conclusive evidence that the family, with its powerful interpersonal dynamics, is a cauldron for the great revolutionary advances that drive historical change. Through his analysis of revolutions in social and scientific thought, from the Reformation to Darwin's theory of natural selection, Sulloway demonstrates that the primary engine of history is located within families, not between them, as Marx believed.This landmark work illuminates the crucial influence that family niches have on personality, and documents the profound consequences of sibling competition - not only on individual development within the family, but on society as a whole. Born to Rebel's pathbreaking insights promise to revolutionize the nature of psychological, sociological, and historical inquiry."
397,"Marking the ongoing efforts to recover the 136-year-old wreck of the USS Monitor, The Mariners' Museum presents a lavishly illustrated commemorative volume of the renowned Civil War ironclad's past and present.  The short, fabled life of the USS Monitor began on January 30, 1862, at Green Point, Brooklyn, New York, and ended on December 31 of that same year, when the legendary Civil War ironclad sank in 230 feet of water off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Serving on the Monitor -- where engines and living space lay completely below the waterline and the iron deck rose a scant eighteen inches above it -- was like no other duty in the U.S. Navy. The Monitor Chronicles brings shipboard experience to life through the words of Civil War sailor George S. Geer, whose never-before-published letters home to his beloved wife, Martha, faithfully chronicle the events of that dramatic year. Like many men of his station, George Geer had joined Abraham Lincoln's navy less to help save the Union than to earn money and learn a reliable trade, so his accounts are unflinchingly honest -- at times colored by the bravado of a man at war, at others tinged with the pathos of a man in danger and far from home. When, on the morning of March 9, 1862, the Monitor and the CSS Virginia fought the first battle between ironclad warships, Geer recalled,""I often thought of you and the little darlings when the fight was going on and what should become of you should I be killed....But I should have no more such fears as our ship resisted everything they could fire at her as though they were spit balls."" Whether he sweated in the searing heat or simply waited while the Monitor danced a strategic minuet with the enemy, his words confirm and amplify the proud legacy of the vessel whose very existence brought an end to the era of wooden warships. On January 2, 1863, Geer reported, ""I am sorry to have to write you that we have lost the Monitor."" He survived, but sixteen men were lost in a raging sea that seemed to have claimed the ship for eternity. But the story told in The Monitor Chronicles doesn't end there. The book captures a piece of living history, as men and machines attempt to recover the wreck even as it begins to succumb to the elements after 136 years on the ocean floor. Because The Mariners' Museum serves as the official repository of the USS Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, readers will be treated to spectacular underwater views of the Monitor, as well as to an unprecedented look at the salvage efforts. Although more than a century has passed since the ship itself sailed into history, The Monitor Chronicles provides not only a fresh, uniquely intimate view of the Monitor's fateful year as the world's first iron warship but also a provocative glimpse of"
398,"Here is the remarkable story of U.S. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton -- impassioned civil rights activist, hard-driving legislator, and one of the most powerful women in American history.  They call her the ""Warrior on the Hill,"" acknowledging the battles she's waged as a political pioneer across more than four decades of American history. Perhaps more than anyone else, she has taken to heart Eleanor Roosevelt's famous pronouncement that ""every political woman needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide.""  Joan Steinau Lester shared much of the last forty years with Eleanor Holmes Norton. They met in 1958 when they were both students at Antioch College. Now an acclaimed author, Lester shares her friendship with the congresswoman and tells the story of one woman's rise to leadership. Charting forty years of political and personal challenge, Fire in My Soul shows Norton marching on the Capitol to demand a Senate hearing for Anita Hill; grilling Army generals about sex abuse; arguing before the Supreme Court to uphold first amendment rights, even for a segregationist; and much more. Norton's story is organically linked to Washington, D.C., home to her family for four generations, and reveals why she is now the voice of the city.  This fascinating biography, told largely in Norton's words, showcases as never before the many facets of a woman who remains an iconic torch-bearer for the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. Scores of conversations with Norton and nearly a hundred interviews with colleagues, family, and friends have made Fire in My Soul a remarkable document of how one extraordinary woman helped to effect lasting change in the ways we interact across racial and gender lines."
399,"In this first comprehensive literary history of Baltimore and Maryland (with notes on Washington writers), Frank R. Shivers, Jr., explores the region's long-overlooked but substantial contribution to American letters. In picture and story, Shivers's lively account ranges from the colonial satire of Ebenezer Cook, to the National Anthem of Francis Scott Key, to the acclaimed works of Poe, Mencken, and Fitzgerald. Here are surprising stories of Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, Dashiel Hammett, Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, and other writers influenced by Chesapeake culture—an influence still fresh in the work of such contemporary writers as John Barth, Anne Tyler, and Russell Baker. ""Nothing,"" wrote Gertrude Stein, ""really can stop anyone living and feeling as they do in Baltimore."" As entertaining as it is informative, Maryland Wits and Baltimore Bards shows us why."
400,"Peter Santore, the narrator, is an American lawyer in his mid-thirties come to England to track down a certain Hilary Pennels, the daughter of a Korean War hero who died in a POW camp, the same camp in which Peter's own father turned traitor and whose informing became, perhaps, the cause of Hilary's father's death. Only Hilary's guardian, Fox himself a survivor of the camp can explain, if he will, the troubling past that haunts the now fully grown ""war babies."" As Frederick Busch's relentless narrative bears down upon this complexity of betrayals, the lines between exploiter and exploited become eerily blurred."

406,"Why does our popular culture seem so consistently hostile to the values that most Americans hold dear? Why does the entertainment industry attack religion, glorify brutality, undermine the family, and deride patriotism? In this explosive book, one of the nation's best known film critics examines how Hollywood has broken faith with its public, creating movies, television, and popular music that exacerbate every serious social problem we face, from teenage pregnancies to violence in the streets. Michael Medved powerfully argues that the entertainment business follows its own dark obsessions, rather than giving the public what it wants: In fact, the audience for feature films and network television has demonstrated its profound disillusionment in recent years, with disastrous consequences for many entertainment companies.  Meanwhile, overwhelming numbers of our fellow citizens complain about the wretched quality of our popular culture--describing the offerings of the mass media as the worst ever.  Medved asserts that Hollywood ignores--and assaults--the values of ordinary American families, pursuing a self-destructive and alienated ideological agenda that is harmful to the nation at large and to the industry's own interests. In hard-hitting chapters on ""The Attack on Religion,"" ""The Addiction to Violence,"" ""Promoting Promiscuity,"" ""The Infatuation with Foul Language,"" ""Kids Know Best,"" ""Motivations for Madness,"" and other subjects, Medved outlines the underlying themes that turn up again and again in our popular culture.  He also offers conclusive evidence of the frightening real-world impact of these messages on our society and our children. Finally, Medved shows where and how Hollywood took a disastrous wrong turn toward its current crisis, and he outlines promising efforts both in and outside the industry to restore a measure of sanity and restraint to our media of mass entertainment.Sure to elicit strong response, whether it takes the form of cheers of support or howls of enraged dissent, Hollywood vs. America confronts head-on one of the most significant issues of our times."

Nicole is a surprise; just graduated from high school-almost an adult-the gap between the little girl Henry once knew and the woman she has become leaves him fumbling for words. Days after Nicole arrives, Henry's girlfriend, Elizabeth, reveals that she is pregnant. Henry is speechless at these two events, throwing into sharp relief his emotional landscape. He best deals with situations like these by heading off to the racetrack in time to make the daily double, and to place a few bets.As Rick Bass writes, ""a beautiful and aching novel, alarming in its wisdom and treatment of one of the great terrors, loneliness, and one of the great mercies, forgiveness."""
410,"This book is a unique account of the way politics has shaped the information age in America. Reed E. Hundt, chairman from 1993 to 1997 of the Federal Communications Commission, the nation’s chief regulatory agency for media and communications industries, tells of the battles for political advantage that lie behind the enormous creation of wealth and social changes that are generally called the “New Economy.” The central theme of the narrative is the surprising passage and fascinating implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which authorized the Federal Communications Commission to replace monopoly with competition and to guarantee access to the Internet to all Americans, including every child in every classroom.Depending on the leadership of his high school classmate Al Gore and finding unexpected allies in the ranks of free market ideologues, Hundt led the FCC to make the decisions that helped start a wave of entrepreneurship, which in turn has given the United States the world’s leading Internet economy. As the memoir shows, every decision involved prodigious political battles—between existing industries and start-ups, between Newt Gingrich and the Clinton-Gore White House, between inside-the-Beltway lobbyists and the new grassroots advocacy of e-mails, between the politics of money and the politics of ideas. In the same period, the often ignored and historically maligned FCC was the place where government decided whether to undertake the largest national initiative to reform K–12 education in the country’s history: the program to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2001.Hundt’s report from the political battlefield offers significant insight into the motives and personality not only of Al Gore but other prominent figures in political life, as well as many of the media moguls of our time. Told with great energy and wit, it is a tale that inspires both concern for and confidence in our democracy in the information age."

435,"With an Epilogue by Miep Giess The first biography of the girl whose fate has touched the lives of millions. For people all over the world, Anne Frank, the vivacious, intelligent Jewish girl with a crooked smile and huge dark eyes, has become the ""human face of the Holocaust."" Her diary of twenty-five months in hiding, a precious record of her struggle to keep hope alive through the darkest days of this century, has touched the hearts of millions. Here, after five decades, is the first biography of this remarkable figure. Drawing on exclusive interviews with family and friends, on previously unavailable correspondence, and on documents long kept secret, Melissa Muller creates a nuanced portrait of her famous subject. This is the flesh-and-blood Anne Frank, unsentimentalized and so all the more affecting--Anne Frank restored to history. Muller traces Frank's life from an idyllic childhood in an assimilated family well established in Frankfurt banking circles to her passionate adolescence in German-occupied Amsterdam and her desperate  in Bergen Belsen at the age of sixteen. Full of revelations, this richly textured biography casts new light on Anne's relations with her mother, whom she treats harshly in the diary, and solves an enduring mystery: who betrayed the families hiding in the annex just when liberation was at hand? This is an indispensable volume for all those who seek a deeper, richer understanding of Anne Frank and the brutal times in which she lived and died."

Why do Amish youth rebel in their teenage years? Are the Amish freeloading on American life? Are the Amish behind or ahead of the modern world?"

We are at a judicial conference where Rothwax stumps fifty appeals court judges, who admit they don't understand the Supreme Court's latest search-and-seizure rulings. We are in the courtroom, where Rothwax must sit patiently and allow lawyers to willfully obfuscate the truth.According to Rothwax, America is fast becoming a nation of bad laws, in which criminals and defense attorneys hide behind a morass of poorly conceived statutes, procedures, and rulings that prevent courts from resolving the paramount question at hand: Did the accused commit the crime? In trial after maddening trial, Rothwax sees the truth sacrificed at the altar of an increasingly areane process designed to protect the rights of criminals."

471,"Here’s some of what just happened: Millions of ordinary, sensible people came into possession of computers. These machines had wondrous powers, yet made unexpected demands on their owners. Telephones broke free of the chains that had shackled them to bedside tables and office desks. No one was out of touch, or wanted to be out of touch. Instant communication became a birthright.A new world, located no one knew exactly where, came into being, called “virtual” or “online,” named “cyberspace” or “the Internet” or just “the network.” Manners and markets took on new shapes and guises.As all this was happening, James Gleick, author of the groundbreaking Chaos, columnist for The New York Times Magazine, and—very briefly—an Internet entrepreneur, emerged as one of our most astute guides to this new world. His dispatches—by turns passionate, bewildered, angry, and amazed—form an extraordinary chronicle. Gleick loves what the network makes possible, and he hates it. Software makers developed a strangely tolerant view of an ancient devil, the product defect. One company, at first a feisty upstart, seized control of the hidden gears and levers of the new economy. We wrestled with novel issues of privacy, anonymity, and disguise. We found that if the human species is evolving a sort of global brain, it’s susceptible to new forms of hysteria and multiple-personality disorder.What Just Happened is at once a remarkable portrait of a world in the throes of transformation and a prescient guide to the transformation still to come."

Or perhaps she did, and meant one day to say so herself. Whatever, The Third Sister is an imaginative, creative continuation of Sense and Sensibility, featuring a Margaret Dashwood, the third sister, once so underestimated, who turns out to fool even her creator."

A woman from Keeney's Louisville church, Bobbie Roberts, confided that her twenty-year-old daughter Deana had recently died in a cliff fall at Big Sur, California. Bobbie was now having trouble collecting burial insurance. Keeney, a successful corporate lawyer, agreed to help her cut through the red tape.The coroner's report stated that a couple named B.J. and Virginia McGinnis had driven Deana to a four-hundred-foot Big Sur cliff. The McGinnises said that when their backs had been turned, the girl had fallen ""without a sound."" Days after reading this report, Keeney was stunned to learn that Virginia had paid for a life insurance policy on Deana one day before the accident.Keeney suspected foul play, but Big Sur authorities quietly dropped the case: There were no witnesses other than the McGinnises. Undeterred, Keeney promised his client that he would try to find out the truth. A chilling portrait emerged.Virginia called herself a practical nurse, but people had dark memories of her ""care."" They recalled her three-year-old daughter, her husband, and her mother - all of whom died while alone with Virginia. A series of fires, thefts, poisonings, and insurance policies ran through her past. Keeney also discovered that both of Virginia's sons had been charged with murder.As Keeney was piecing the facts together, he realized he had uncovered a remorseless killer, one who beat the system for twenty years, collecting insurance along the way.Former prosecutor David Heilbroner, author of the highly acclaimed book Rough Justice, spent two-and-a-half years retracing Keeney's investigation, preserving accounts of many witnesses whose voices were never heard at Virginia's extraordinary two-month murder trial - a trial that literally took the jury to the edge of the Big Sur cliff. In Death Benefit, he crafts a meticulous account of both a killer's life and a Kentucky lawyer's dedication to decency and courage triumphant over evil. Death Benefit belongs to that rare breed of books - a powerful human drama and a true-life courtroom thriller."
482,"Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman here confronts one of the momentous issues of American history and the American present--the contending prerogatives of the president and Congress in making war.Lehman, a lively controversialist and scholar, examines the history of American military decision making from the Revolutionary period to the Gulf War. Whose power is it to declare war, to carry it out, and to sustain its course and bring it to an end? In addressing these major constitutional questions, Lehman is vibrantly contemporary, too, writing as a government insider to offer a exceptionally vivid perspective on Operation Desert Storm and recent military actions in Grenada, Libya, Lebanon, and Panama. Arguing vehemently for the primacy of presidential over congressional power, Lehman adds crucial new details to our understanding of the post-Vietnam era of American politics.Characteristically, Lehman pulls no punches. He sheds provocative new light on congressional investigations into Watergate and Iran-Contra, authoritatively demonstrating the ways in which Congress has created crippling impediments to presidential power. Yet he provides a fresh understanding of the essential role Congress must play in committing the nation to war, and he enumerates how presidents from Jefferson to Bush have interpreted--and misinterpreted--the powers grated them as commander in chief.John Lehman's enlightening new book makes a invaluable contribution as to whether responsible judgments will be made if and when the nation must again confront the crucial decision of making war."

Many famous and brilliant writers have led withdrawn, prosaic, uneventful lives; but Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, existed almost wholly in the real, external world--active, social, sadly typical of that frantic time in which he experienced instant success and fame, followed by a long decline and failure. Arthur Mizener is well known as the author of the first full-scale biography of Fitzgerald. In this book, Professor Mizener looks at the facts of Fitzgerald's short life, offering insights into the subtle way in which actual events were transformed and woven into the novels. With the aid of contemporary photographs from all stages of Fitzgerald's career he tells the human story and provides an important assessment of Fitzgerald's achievement."
491,"America's research universities--some fifty leading intellectual centers--have assumed a unique set of responsibilities. In addition to educating undergraduates, they house most of the nation's basic research and train virtually all new scientists and scholars. The health of these institutions is critical to the nation's intellectual life as well as to its economic well-being, military posture, and foreign policy. Robert Rosenzweig, reporting on a project sponsored by the Association of American Universities, examines the core functions of the research universities and explores how they might best relate to their powerful patrons: the national government, foundations, business, and industry."

493,"The spirit of adventure sweeps through the chapters of this exciting volume as we encounter the inspiring, sometimes tragic, often humorous tales of adventurous women -- from the 18th century to the 21st century.  Selected from National Geographic's rich archives, this colorful group portrait pairs female adventurers of the past with their contemporary counterparts -- in a ""then and now"" approach.  You'll meet Arctic explorers -- an American heiress who crisscrossed ice fields seven decades ago, along with a celebrated New Zealander who skied alone to both North and South Poles in the 1990s. You'll also join in the atmospheric exploits of Shannon Lucid and Amelia Earhart as they take off on those daring flights that wrote a new pages in the annals of aviation.  Tour the world with women who defied Victorian convention to venture alone among the headhunters of Borneo or to see first hand the hidden corners of Africa, India, and Japan. Witness world record-breaking moments by such latterday legends as Sylvia Earle, whose explorations of the ocean floor earned her the nickname, ""Her Royal Deepness,"" and Catherine Destivelle, the beautiful French superstar of modern mountaineering.  Featuring photographs, art, and period illustrations, as well as an introduction by Reeve Lindbergh and a 1,500-year time line of women's adventuring, Living With Cannibals offers vivid testimony to the wanderlust, daring, and determination of these intrepid journeyers.  Whether kayaking remote Tibetan rivers or bottle-feeding baby orangutans, bicycling to India or battling icebergs off the coast of Greenland, each woman profiled here demonstrates her unswerving devotion to a dream."
494,"The authoritative account of America’s most controversial war since Vietnam, a conflict in which “shock and awe” were not confined to the battlefield It was a war like no other the United States had ever fought. It began with the bombing of Saddam Hussein’s bunker and ended with statues of the Iraqi dictator being toppled in downtown Baghdad, and it marked a turning point in America’s relations with its enemies, its allies, and its sense of itself. Yet most Americans experienced the war as impressionistic and often confusing—the story of one battle here, one unit there, a report from one city, then another, without the larger context we so urgently needed. Each reporter had his “slice” of the war, it seemed, but no one had the whole story or the broad view.A Time of Our Choosing fills that gap brilliantly, drawing on the unparalleled resources and reportage of The New York Times. Todd S. Purdum, one of the paper’s most gifted storytellers, traces the war in Iraq from the first rumblings after 9/11, to the diplomatic recriminations at the United Nations, to the battles themselves and their aftermath. He deftly rolls out the whole canvas before our eyes, showing how the individual “slices” fit together into a single, gripping drama.Purdum also explores the complex legacy of America’s near-unilateral action. Since the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush has vowed that the United States would confront its enemies “at a time of our choosing,” and Purdum shows in vivid terms what this choice has meant for our now transformed world."
495,"Now, for the first time, Fox News political analyst and former Clinton adviser Dick Morris turns his sharp-eyed gaze on Hillary, the longtime First Lady, current New York senator, and bestselling author. For, as he argues, no politician in America today is better aligned to become president in 2008—and none would bring more baggage to the White House—than Mrs. Clinton. In Rewriting History, Morris draws on his own long working relationship with the Clintons, as well as his trademark deep research and candid, nonpartisan analysis, to create a rebuttal to Hillary's bestselling autobiography, Living History. Morris documents how Hillary hides her true self behind a ""Hillary"" brand that is chatty, charming, giggly, and warm—but is far from her true personality.In Rewriting History, Morris pierces the mask to get at the truth behind the distortions and omissions of Hillary's memoir. Here we meet the real Hillary, both good and bad: the manager who makes the trains run on time, but also the paranoid who sees all those who disagree with her as personal enemies; the idealist, but also the ""advice addict"" easily misled by the guru of the moment. Morris describes Hillary's sense of entitlement, and warns that it may lead deep into financial scandal. And he demonstrates how Hillary dodges criticism by pretending that every attack is directed not just at her, but at every working woman in America. Ultimately, Morris argues, the Hillary Clinton of today is marketing a false front, obscuring both her wants and her assets behind the phony facade of a domestic Everywoman. But as she pursues higher office, she also faces a choice. Will she, like Bobby Kennedy, see the error of her ruthless ways, and embrace the sincere idealism she professes? Or, like Richard Nixon, will she allow the darker angels of her nature to overcome her, jeopardizing herself and the country in the process?As Rewriting History suggests, we can only hope that Hillary Clinton's past performance is no guarantee of future results."
496,"In recent years, much attention has been lavished on the New Women of rap and rock. From rap stars such as Queen Latifah to bands such as Velocity Girls, popular music has been aggressively redefined by a new generation of women, with a startling range of musical styles. Yet, women's role in contemporary music, and in music history, extends far beyond MTV or the latest riot grrrl troupe. In Girls! Girls! Girls!, Sarah Cooper has assembled a broad- ranging collection of essays to provide an entertaining and impressionistic portrait of women and music. Whether in the form of Helen Kolawole's discussion of the bitch- bashing misogyny of gangsta rap or Caroline Sullivan's exuberant assessment of women rock critics, the volume raises, and addresses, some of the most provocative and challenging issues concerning women's active involvement in and relationship to music. From indie labels to opera queens, from symphony orchestra to salsa queen, from swing to women's music in South Asia to the confessions of a British country music fan, Girls! Girls! Girls! has something for everyone, music critics, feminists, and fans alike."
497,"One hot summer morning, William Hallberg, author of The Rub of the Green, set off on an odyssey across the United States to penetrate - and illuminate - the soul of golf. No course was too grand, no driving range too humble for a stop on Hallberg's unpredictable tour of America's verdant and not-so-verdant golf venues. He tackled Kiawah Island's diabolical and breathtaking Ocean Course with a party of well-heeled Southern gents. He tromped through sagebrush roughs and kikuyu bunkers in the Nevada outback. He encountered the ghost of a cherished golfing buddy during a memorable round in the Smokies. And between games he nursed his wounds, pondered his constantly mutating handicap, and commiserated with fellow golfers in dusky sports bars, greasy spoons, and rain-soaked motel parking lots.The Soul of Golf will make you laugh out loud, swallow hard in the face of painful truths, and ultimately head yet again for your favorite golf course, where fate lies in ambush."

499,"Love. Sex. Respect. Race. Politics. Unity. Spirituality. Cultural pride. These are some of the concerns expressed by twenty-six African American women in interviews with filmmaker-writer Courtney Long about what they wish for in African American men. And these issues are only part of the main concern shared by these women: that the gap between black men and women is widening into a chasm. The straight-talking sisters in Love Awaits discuss their brothers in the hope that they are taking the first step toward building a bridge of mutual understanding, unity, and peace - and creating a common ground for love and relationship.Arranged by topic, these interviews on love, sex, and growing up in the African American culture examine with honesty and raw energy the positive and negative aspects of relations between black women and men. They explore sources of pain and of healing between the sexes, obstacles to relating and new ways of being together. Candidly expressing her needs, desires, and expectations, each woman brings her own unique experiences, viewpoint, and personality to the discussion, weaving her own strand into the vibrant tapestry of the African American experience."

To help orient the inevitable debates on this agenda, experts from Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs here examine a set of key issues and problems that, taken together, define the scope and limits of such a policy.Among the topics discussed are the new relationship between federal and state governments implied by the administration's proposals, the usefulness of the concept of ""critical technologies"" for setting priorities, the creation of new missions for the national laboratories (particularly the three weapons laboratories), the changing nature of the social contract between the government and research universities, the problems that will confront the creation of a national information infrastruc­ture, the best ways to promote small- ­and medium-sized ""driver"" companies as well as civilian research and development generally, and the relationship between education and the requirements for work in the twenty-first century.Lewis M.

She seems to have fallen from the sky, like Sky Woman of the Oneida creation myth. When Anna and Emmett discover that Brenda was at the center of a bitter land dispute between Indians and white settlers who have lived on the land for many generations, they are sure she was murdered. Their investigation takes them to the edge of a simmering cauldron. Flag-waving whites are picketing the Turning Stone Casino and other Oneida-owned businesses. Indians are cruising with guns in their cars. Added to the dangers of race war is the presence of all the money-grubbing interests drawn to a lucrative casino. As their pool of suspects - of all colors - grows, Anna and Emmett's own lives depend on Anna's instincts, and her ability to see the line where myth and reality come together."
514,"The California Gold Rush captured the get-rich dreams of people around the world more completely than almost any event in American history. This catalog, published in celebration of the sesquicentennial of the 1848 discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, shows the vitality of the arts in the Golden State during the latter nineteenth century and documents the dramatic impact of the Gold Rush on the American imagination.Among the throngs of gold-seekers in California were artists, many self-taught, others formally trained, and their arrival produced an outpouring of artistic works that provide insights into Gold Rush events, personages, and attitudes. The best-known painting of the Gold Rush era, C.C. Nahl's Sunday Morning in the Mines (1872), was created nearly two decades after gold fever had subsided. By then the Gold Rush's mythic qualities were well established, and new allegories—particularly the American belief in the rewards of hard work and enterprise—can be seen on Nahl's canvas. Other works added to the image of California as a destination for ambitious dreamers, an image that prevails to this day. In bringing together a range of art and archival material such as artists' diaries and contemporary newspaper articles, The Art of the Gold Rush broadens our understanding of American culture during a memorable period in the nation's history."

517,"Why did Abraham Lincoln approve of compromises over slavery?  How could he have thought that most black Americans would accept voluntary segregation as the way to freedom?  Why, in spite of Lincoln's shortcomings, did the black leader Frederick Douglass think that the president's accomplishments were more remarkable than those of the founding fathers?  In providing at least partial answers to these questions, Lincoln and Slavery gives us a fresh look at a subject often shadowed by misinformation.  Here, we follow the young Lincoln as he takes an interest in the law and becomes a legislator. In a series of debates with his political opponent Stephen Douglas, we hear Lincoln argue forcefully that slavery, if allowed to spread, would destroy democracy.  As Lincoln and Slavery focuses on Lincoln's years as president, we see him work on the Emancipation Proclamation -- which changed the purpose of the Civil War and welcomed black men into military service. We go with him to Gettysburg, where he reaffirms ""the proposition that all men are created equal."" We listen to him, only weeks before his death, as he proclaims that the Union armies will keep fighting ""until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid for by another drawn with the sword.""  This is the story of a great American, a man who hated slavery and believed, above all else, that democracy was the best hope for humankind -- in his time and in all the years to come."

Expanding upon her pathbreaking work in The Reproduction of Mothering and combining significant new writings with previously published essays, Nancy J. Chodorow elucidates how the unconscious awareness of self and gender we develop from earliest infancy continues to shape both our experience as men and women and the patterns of inequality and difference that exist throughout our society and culture. ""Chodorow is an exceptionally intelligent and serious writer, and her contribution to the debate on gender and sexual identity is substantial. . . . Through her deepening reflections on gender issues and her study of the reality of women's lives, Ms. Chodorow puts both Freud and feminism to the test.""—Stuart Schneiderman, New York Times Book Review ""In [a book] teeming with ideas, Chodorow . . . explores issues such as the influence of maternal care on the emerging self, social oppression of women on the basis of presumed gender differences, Oedipal conglict, heterosexual identification, and women analysts.""—Publishers Weekly ""These essays are as good a statement of the issues in feminist psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic feminism as I have seen, reflecting the knowledge and questions of an 'insider' in both areas. One is impressed by the richness of the implications drawn from observed constellations or relationships. This is book that should be of interest to a wide audience.""—Malkah T. Notman, M.D., Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association ""All readers will profit from reading all of the articles in historical sequence. Her own changes reflect some general trends in feminist and social science thought.""—Miriam M. Johnson, Contemporary Sociology"
520,"How Americans describe their guiding principles in an exhilarating and unnerving new era of moral freedom. What is the difference between right and wrong? What does it mean to lead a good life? How binding is the marriage vow? What are your obligations to an employer? To your friends? To yourself? Is it always immoral to tell a lie? Eminent sociologist and public intellectual Alan Wolfe asked Americans around the country such questions in order to determine how we really think about morality today. Wolfe discovered that while values have changed, they are far from absent. Americans of all stripesfrom the most radical to the most traditionalwant to lead a good life, but in almost every case they are determined to decide for themselves what a good life means. Focusing on traditional virtues of loyalty, honesty, self-restraint, and forgiveness, Moral Freedom reveals the complexities of living in a society where rather than simply accepting strict conventions, each individual struggles to forge a moral life."

531,"Now, at last, it can be revealed! The TRUTH behind the legend!  That Kinky Friedman... Where did he come from? How did he get that way? Shouldn't someone have called 911 long ago?   Now, in Blast from the Past, nationally bestselling author Kinky Friedman has searched his failing memory and has come up with a novel about his early days in New York City and how Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed country music performer, became Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed ace detective.  In this prequel to his earlier novels, one which gives new meaning to the term ""retro,"" Kinkster fans are given the definitive answer to two of literature's great burning questions: Where the hell did those weird characters come from anyway? And what about that puppet head?  Of course, it's not just Kinky himself who gets retroed, but all the Village Irregulars as well -- Ratso, Rambam, and McGovern -- who are glimpsed in the nascent stage, as is the ever-luscious Stephanie DuPont, who blasts upon the scene as a five-year-old nymphet in patent-leather spikes.   Imagine it's the '70s. Imagine the Lone Star Cafe is still alive and well. Imagine that it's still okay to do drugs, still okay to have unprotected sex, still okay to paddle a brat and spank a monkey. And imagine you are there, in the '70s, at the Lone Star, sipping a brew with the Kinkster, a much younger, even kinkier Kinky -- uncouth, unshaped, unrepentant, and frequently unconscious.  But lest you think that Blast from the Past is all nostalgia, be assured that Kinky has supplied a bang-up plot as well, much of which revolves around the mystery of who this guy Tim is who Judy exclaims about while being hosed by Kinky, and the question of whether or not the Feds have found Abbie Hoffman, who has been playing hide-and-seek in Ratso's apartment. Or something like that.  As always, it's great, unpredictable fun from a true original, whose ""Irreverent, bawdy and often outrageous adventures are like no others,"" as says The San Diego Union-Tribune. In Blast from the Past, you'll find the Kinkster in top form and at his most outrageous."

540,"Is it the war to end all wars - or war without end? What began as a conflict in Europe, when Germany unleashed a lightning assault on its enemies, soon spread to North America, as a long-simmering hatred between two independent nations explodes. Twice in fifty years the Confederate States of America has humiliated their northern neighbor. Now revenge may at last be at hand.Under the leadership of Teddy Roosevelt, and following a general named Custer - military genius or madman? - the United States are fighting a war on two fronts in 1917. In the north, from the Pacific to Quebec, U.S. forces in the air and on land are locked in battle against Canada and Great Britain. To the south, at the heart of a line that stretches from the Gulf of California to the Atlantic, Custer intends to do what none of his predecessors had ever managed: to smash through the Confederate barbwire entrenchments in Tennessee.Here are leather-jacketed daredevil pilots flying unproved fighters into anti-aircraft fire. Here is a melee on the sea, as U.S. sailors duel Confederate submariners, while the English, French, and Japanese surface navies vie for control of the shipping lanes. In Harry Turtledove's incredibly imagined alternate history, the Great War is played out over a cast of vivid characters. Amid the sound and fury of battle, as nonaligned nation-states choose sides and politicians spew bombast far from the front lines, The Great War: Breakthroughs captures a world war at an apocalyptic turning point. Victory is at hand - but at a price that may be worse than war itself."

545,"Harriet Scott Chessman takes us into the world of Mary Cassatt's early Impressionist paintings through Mary's sister Lydia, whom the author sees as Cassatt’s most inspiring muse. Chessman hauntingly brings to life Paris in 1880, with its thriving art world. The novel’s subtle power rises out of a sustained inquiry into art’s relation to the ragged world of desire and mortality. Ill with Bright’s disease and conscious of her approaching death, Lydia contemplates her world narrowing. With the rising emotional tension between the loving sisters, between one who sees and one who is seen, Lydia asks moving questions about love and art’s capacity to remember. Chessman illuminates Cassatt’s brilliant paintings and creates a compelling portrait of the brave and memorable model who inhabits them with such grace. Lydia Cassatt Reading the Morning Paper includes five full-color plates, the entire group of paintings Mary Cassatt made of her sister."

In her hometown, Hallie reconnects with a beloved childhood friend, Rose, who is now a writer and pregnant with her third child. Chessman beautifully evokes the childhood memories of the two friends, illuminating their very different lives. As in Lydia Cassatt Reading the Morning Paper, Chessman’s compassionate and perceptive gaze reveals an entire new world for us—one that is subtle, alive, and deeply honest."

551,"These ten timeless principles were first articulated by the author when he was a student at Harvard in the nineteen sixties. Since then, they've traveled around the world and back again-usually with no attribution at all. They've been cited as an anonymous poem on more than eighty websites; appropriated as song lyrics; quoted in books and by business leaders; circulated by organizations from the Boy Scouts to the Special Olympics; and tacked to the wall of Mother Teresa's children's home in Calcutta.  It was upon learning about this last appearance that Kent Keith was moved to put his commandments, the philosophy behind them, and the stories that bring them to life into this modern credo for living well, being happy, and doing good anyway."
552,"With the death of Leonard Bernstein in 1990, the music world lost one of its most vital forces. Bernstein's death came only a matter of days after he had announced his retirement from conducting, and the news was received with incredulity and shock around the world. A composer, a conductor, a pianist, host of the wildly popular Omnibus series and theYoung People's Concerts, Bernstein was in many ways a pioneer. The first American to conduct at La Scala (Cherubini'sMedea in 1953 with Maria Callas), and the first to take over a major American orchestra when he became Music Director of the New York Philharmonic in 1958, he gave a new respectability to the idea of the American-born-and-trained musician. As Tim Page wrote in Newsday after Bernstein's death, Bernstein's decision to make a career in America was ""a declaration of independence"" for his generation of American musicians.In Conversations About Bernstein, friends, critics, and collaborators, as well as the world-class musicians who shared the stage with Bernstein, remember the private artist behind the public flamboyance and acclaim. In an unprecedented series of interviews with author William Westbrook Burton, they reveal how Bernstein worked, the perennial conflicts in his personal and professional lives, and why he made the choices that he did. Here are not only the great triumphs--the stunning debuts as conductor with the New York or the Vienna Philharmonics, the rapturous reception of the incomparableWest Side Story--but the moments of self-doubt and crushing disappointment as well. Composer Lukas Foss remembers Bernstein as a preternaturally poised young student under pressure to work in his father's beauty parlor business. FormerNew York Times critic Harold Schonberg maintains that his unrelentingly negative reviews of Bernstein's performances made no difference to Bernstein's career. Carol Lawrence recreates the historic first production ofWest Side Story. Conductor John Mauceri recalls with deep affection Bernstein's sometimes maddening methods of conducting and composing, and members of Bernstein's orchestras as well as opera stars Christa Ludwig, Frederica Von Stade, Jerry Hadley, and renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich share recollections of memorable recordings and performances.A portrait emerges of a remarkably generous conductor and musical theatre collaborator adored worldwide, who nonetheless believed at the end of his life that his single most cherished ambition--the creation of a serious masterwork--remained unrealized. Candid, entertaining, and often moving, Conversations About Bernstein is a deeply enjoyable look at the career of arguably the most famous musician of our time."

564,"As correspondent for Newsweek, Michael Hirsh has traveled to every continent, reporting on American foreign policy. Now he draws on his experience to offer an original explanation of America's role in the world and the problems facing the nation today and in the future.        Using colorful vignettes and up-close reporting from his coverage of the first two post-Cold War presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Hirsh argues that America has a new role never before played by any nation: it is the world's Uberpower, overseeing the global system from the air, land, sea and, increasingly, from space as well. And that means America has a unique opportunity do what no great power in history has ever done--to perpetuate indefinitely the global system it has built, to create an international community with American power at its center that is so secure it may never be challenged. Yet Americans are squandering this chance by failing to realize what is at stake. At the same time that America as a nation possesses powers it barely comprehends, Americans as individuals have vulnerabilities they never before imagined. They desperately need the international community on their side.      In an era when democracy and free markets have become the prevailing ideology, Hirsh argues, one of America's biggest problems will be ""ideological blowback""--facing up to the flaws and contradictions of its own ideals. Hence, for example, the biggest threat to political stability is not totalitarianism, but the tricky task of instituting democracy in the Arab world without giving Islamic fundamentalists the reigns of power. The only way for Washington to avoid accusations of hypocrisy is to allow the global institutions it has built, like the U.N., to do the hard work of promoting U.S. values."

Overwhelmingly, she discovers, it's the working mother who takes on the second shift.Hochschild finds that men share housework equally with their wives in only twenty percent of dual-career families. While many women accept this inequity in order to keep peace, they tend to suffer from chronic exhaustion, low sex drive, and more frequent illness as a result. The ultimate cost is the forfeited health and happiness of both partners, and often the survival of the marriage itself.With a new afterword by the author, this groundbreaking study is as relevant today as when it was first published."

575,"Back-to-back Most Valuable Player and World Series winner Joe Morgan entered the Hall of Fame in 1990 on the first ballot, a ""good little player"" who achieved greatness by hard work, dedication, and baseball intelligence. In this entertaining book, be tells the story of his extraordinary life in baseball and offers provocative insights into the game's past, present, and future.The box score? The most complete player of his time has given us the complete baseball book, from the grit of the infield dirt on his spikes as he turned a double play against a charging Frank Robinson to no-holds-barred banter in the locker room with Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, and Pete Rose, from the frustration of seeing good teams destroyed by racism and incompetence to the triumph of winning it all with the most talented, and the smartest, team in baseball, Cincinnati's Big Red Machine.In vivid anecdotes, Joe Morgan recounts starting out in the minor leagues in the still-segregated South, the only black player on the Durham Bulls; earning a trip to the majors with the expansion Colt 45s (soon to become the Houston Astros), a rag tag collection of over-the-hill veterans and inexperienced youngsters with its own band of outlaws, ""The Dalton Gang""; honing his game with the help of all-time-great Nellie Fox; competing against the likes of Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Tom Seaver, Reggie Jackson, Willie McCovey, and Willie Stargell; winning back to back MVP awards and World Series; dramatic seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, San Francisco Giants, and Oakland A's; and being welcomed into the Hall of Fame by his childhood idol, Ted Williams.At the heart of the book is the tale of how four big, combative egos - Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, Pete Rose, and Morgan himself - learned to win together under Sparky Anderson's leadership, transforming the Cincinnati Reds into the Big Red Machine, the most successful team of the 1970s. Joe Morgan shows us how the Reds dominated games with sheer baseball smarts as well as awesome physical skill, and he gives us up-close views of his teammates, including Sparky Anderson's gift for molding individuals into a team dedicated to winning, Johnny Bench's flair for the dramatic play, Tony Perez's unquenchable will-to-win in the clutch, and Pete Rose's tumultuous experiences on and off the field. It's all here, from the day Dave Concepcion took a ride in the locker room dryer to George Foster's reply to an accusation of cheating: ""I don't cork my bat. I cork my arm.""Bringing his unparalleled feel for winning baseball right up to the present, Morgan also gives us hard-hitting commentary on the current state of the game, discussing why today's teams play brain dead, what keeps Rickey Henderson and other stars from being as great as they think they are, why good teams self-destruct so easily, why the new commissioner will find it hard to act ""in the best interests of baseball,"" and how baseball ought to deal with such issues as expansion, free agency, and minority hiring. His controversial prescription for baseball's future - the appointment of a baseball ambassador empowered to negotiate with both players and owners for the good of the game - will spark lively debate all through the season and beyond.The final tally: here is a baseball read with the spark that made Joe Morgan the winningest player of his time."

Over 160 million people died in war during the 20th century, and in Wilson's Ghost, Robert S. McNamara and James G. Blight put forth a decisive, multi-faceted action program for realizing Wilson's dream during this century. The plan begins with a moral imperative that establishes as a major goal of foreign policy across the globe the avoidance of war. To that end,enforcement entails only multilateral intervention on the part of the United States; full reconciliation with Russia and China to integrate those nations into relations with the other Great Powers; restructuring the United Nations to greater effectiveness; defining and deterring war crimes; creating UN enforcement; and finally, reducing nuclear danger by eliminating the huge arsenal held by the United States and Russia, and by signing into law the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The authors support their plan with specific, achievable steps that can begin now to ensure a more peaceful 21st century."
583,"In 2000 Vermont became the first state to grant gay and lesbian couples the right to join in civil unions-a groundbreaking decision that has inspired similar legislation in six states thus far. But it was not an easy victory; the ruling sparked the fiercest political conflict in the state's memory. David Moats was in the thick of it, writing a series of balanced, humane editorials that earned a Pulitzer Prize. Now he tells the intimate stories behind the battle and introduces us to all the key actors in the struggle, including the couples who first filed suit; the lawyers who spent years championing the case; and the only openly gay legislator in Vermont, who ensured victory with an impassioned, deeply personal speech on the House floor at a crucial moment.

584,"Jane Austen sprang from the upper middle class society of late eighteenth century southern England. Orthodox in morals and religion, generally Tory in politics--this was the milieu that she describes so memorably in her novels. Indeed her environment provided her with material ideally suited to her talents: accurate observation of character, wit, dramatic intuition, an ear for realistic dialogue, and a highly disciplined formal sense. These gifts, evident in the early and satirical novels Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensibility, found their perfect expression in the great books of her maturity, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion. The late novelist and critic Marghanita Laski brings to this illustrated biography the fruits of a long and loving study of Jane Austen, her work, her letters, and her time."

594,"'I have brought you to the ring, now hop if you can.'Wallace's famous injunction before the battle of Falkirk is still remembered today. The first section of this major new biography deals with the history of Wallace and his time. According to legend, born and brought up in Elderslie, Wallace's courage and heroism during Scotland's darkest days were instrumental in creating a sense of national identity. From the early killing of the Sheriff of Lanark, Sir William Haslerigg, through his crowning triumph at Stirling Bridge to his terrible end, Wallace was unswerving in his devotion to the cause of Scottish freedom. The brutality of his end is a testament to the fear and humiliation his name inspired in Edward I.The second section of the book studies the impact of the man and the myth on later generations. The guerrilla tactics initiated by Wallace were later used by Robert the Bruce to great success. Blind Harry's epic poem (1478) personifies the will and desire of Scottish people for independence in the figure of Wallace. Over 200 years after his death Scotland's greatest knight continues to inspire nationalists in this country and throughout the world.Peter Reese's objective and lucid text concludes with the judgement that Wallace's martyrdom was a greater legacy to the Scots than even the achievements of his lifetime. While he was alive, the power of his personality galvanised a nation. Since his death, the memory of William Wallace has endured as an inspiration for unity."
595,"In his first collection since the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain, Robert Olen Butler dazzles anew with his mastery of the short-story form and his true empathy for the denizens of the less-well-explored corners of the human condition. Though his mirthful and appropriately absurd story titles - ""Boy Born with Tattoo of Elvis,"" ""Titanic Victim Speaks Through Waterbed,"" ""Woman Uses Glass Eye to Spy on Philandering Husband,"" and ""JFK Secretly Attends Jackie Auction,"" among others - reflect Butler's genuine fondness for the outsized fancies of tabloid readers' and writers' imaginations, his ambitions are not so lighthearted or ephemeral. Once again he explores the enduring issues of cultural exile, loss, aspiration, and the search for the self.

597,"With a light heart and in the nicest, most insightful way, Joann Davis invites us to stop running around in circles. If we stop working for the cheese at the end of the maze, for the biggest toys at the end of the day, who knows what we could accomplish or how we might feel? This little book is nothing less than a game plan for creating a life that counts.In the tradition of Robert Fulghum, ""The Little Secret That Can Change Your Life""* is a collection of short inspirational essays designed to help readers discover the path to a more meaningful life, one that is less about running the modern rat race of workaholism, consumerism, debt, and frustration. The book suggests that a more rewarding way of living comes when we realize that beneath the surface of life is a spiritual economy made up of virtues and values. Money and material things matter, but they aren't everything. We must be careful not to gain the world and lose our souls.""Our inner world is ours to make of what we choose. Magnificent changes can radiate out of every human heart if we so desire. So then, if you are open, brave, and willing to take the challenge, read on. See if you don't agree that there's much more to life than winning the rat race.""If every person who reads this book chooses one way to leave the rat race and passes the idea to just one other person, in no time at all our national priorities could change. Children could become more important than money. Virtue could become its own reward. Corporate greed could become passe.There are rules for rats -- Bite off more than you can chew. Act as if enough isn't -- ever. View life as part of work, instead of work as a part of life. Follow them all, win the race, and you'll still be -- a rat There are rules for mice -- No fighting, no biting. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. If you can't fight 'em, lick 'em."
598,"Walter Toland has the heart and soul of a hero - but his physical body is confined to a wheelchair. He lost both his legs and his job in the line of duty as a policeman.Baal Curran is a high school senior, full of the promise and heartbreak of her first love, and her first loss. The needle scarring from her diabetes drove away the only boy ever to care for her. Now she has retreated inside herself, determined never to be hurt again.Both of them have discovered Killobyte, an exciting new fantasy adventure game that promises to be the most realistic experience they can imagine. Once again Walter can have the strong legs of a hero, charging through a castle to rescue a captive princess, battling a ferocious dragon, matching wits with a sorcerer. With her face hidden behind a fictional character, Baal can forget her shyness and her fear that others will shrink away from her because of her lifetime of illness. She can laugh and have adventures, and dare to care about someone else again.But Killobyte is more real than even its creators can have dreamed. Within its programming lurks a flaw that has allowed one demented player a kind of power its creators never intended - a power that can trap and ""kill"" Walter and Baal time after time in the game scenarios.Of course, as long as this game of cat and mouse is kept within the world of computer-generated adventures, it's only a frustration. Walter and Baal seem never to win. But as the games continue, they begin to wonder whether the power of this mystery player can extend outside the framework of the game....The mystery player is out for power - and the power he has in mind is far more than just racking up points against fictional opponents. He's coming after Walter and Baal in the real world, and his threat is death."

604,"A luminous, poignant true story, Alison Smith's stunning first book, Name All the Animals, is an unparalleled account of grief and secret love: the tale of a family clinging to the memory of a lost child, and a young woman struggling to define herself in the wake of his loss.As children, siblings Alison and Roy Smith were so close that their mother called them by one name: Alroy. But on a cool summer morning when Alison was fifteen, she woke to learn that Roy, eighteen, was dead. This is Smith's extraordinary account of the impact of that loss -- on herself, on her parents, and on a deeply religious community.At home, Alison and her parents sleepwalk in shifts. Alison hoards food for her lost brother, hides in the backyard fort they built together, and waits for him to return. During the day, she breaks every rule at Our Lady of Mercy School for Girls, where the baffled but loving nuns offer prayer, Shakespeare, and a job running the switchboard. In the end, Alison finds her own way to survive: a startling and taboo first love that helps her discover a world beyond the death of her brother.An intimate book written in clear-eyed prose, Name All the Animals announces a brilliant new writer with a keen insight into the emotional life of the American family, the power of sibling love and loyalty, and the excruciating joy of first, forbidden love. Smith tells the story through her own fifteen-year-old eyes, with such expert pacing and narrative suspense that readers will find the book hard to put down.Heartbreaking but hopeful, this is ultimately a book less about loss than it is about love -- about the excitement and anguish of Alison's first love, about her parents' enduring romance, about a community's passion for its faith, and about a well-loved boy who dies too young. A fiercely beautiful, redemptive book, it is sure to be a classic."

610,"Nearly three years have passed since that tragic day in September. Since then, our wounds have healed, but our senses and memories have dulled.At first, the nation rallied behind its leader. But by the time the confrontation with Iraq presented itself, our courage and moral certainty seemed to fade in the face of partisan bickering and posturing.Now the political left and the Democratic Party are trying to use the demanding aftermath of the war to exploit our national cause for their own political advantage.How could we allow ourselves to forget so soon?--from Deliver Us from EvilSean Hannity's first blockbuster book, the New York Times bestseller Let Freedom Ring, cemented his place as the freshest and most compelling conservative voice in the country. As the host of the phenomenally successful Hannity & Colmes on the Fox News Channel and The Sean Hannity Show on ABC Radio, Hannity has won a wildly devoted fan base. Now he brings his plainspoken, take-no-prisoners style to the continuing War on Terror abroad -- and liberalism at home -- in Deliver Us from Evil.""Evil exists,"" Hannity asserts. ""It is real, and it means to harm us."" And in these pages he revisits the harsh lessons America has learned in confronting evil in the past and the present, to illuminate the course we must take in the future. Tracing a direct line from Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin through Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, he reminds us of the courage and moral clarity of our great leaders. And he reveals how the disgraceful history of appeasement has reached forward from the days of Neville Chamberlain and Jimmy Carter to corrupt the unrepentant leftists of the modern Democratic Party -- from Howard Dean and John Kerry to Bill and Hillary Clinton. As Americans face the ongoing war against terrorists and their state sponsors around the world, Sean Hannity reminds us that we must also cope with the continuing scourge of accommodation and cowardice at home. With his trademark blend of passion and hard-hitting commentary, he urges Americans to recognize the dangers of putting our faith in toothless ""multilateralism"" when the times call for decisive action. For only through strong defense of our freedoms, at home and around the world, can we preserve America's security and liberty in the dangerous twenty-first century."

614,"What are the books that helped shape and define the last hundred years? This was the question put to the librarians of The New York Public Library as part of the Library's 100th anniversary celebration. Which books had influenced the course of events for good or ill? Which interpreted new worlds? Or delighted millions of readers? Their answers to these questions formed ""Books of the Century,"" a highly popular exhibit during the Library's centennial celebration (1895 to 1995), highlighting an exhilarating collection of important works by some of the greatest writers of our times.     Now, the companion volume, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century takes readers on a thought-provoking tour of the last hundred years, through the medium of the printed word. Here readers will find over 150 pivotal works organized into topical categories, reflecting themes that have informed the century, among them ""Mind & Spirit,"" ""Protest & Progress,"" ""Women Rise,"" or ""Nature's Realm."" Each is introduced with a brief commentary illuminating the themes and issues the books in that section address, followed by an annotation for each title offering a brief description and a key to its significance.  The range of books is remarkable, embracing Chekhov's Three Sisters and Bram Stoker's Dracula, as well as Galbraith's The Affluent Society and Durkheim's Suicide, or Timothy Leary's The Politics of Ecstasy and W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk. Readers will find many illuminating juxtapositions. In ""Utopias & Dystopias,"" for instance, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, and Lost Horizon are in the unexpected company of Nineteen Eighty-four, A Clockwork Orange, Brave New World, and The Time Machine. The century's darkest moments are mirrored in ""War, Holocaust, Totalitarianism,"" where we find Koestler's Darkness at Noon, Hersey's Hiroshima, Anne Frank's Diary, and Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. But the volume ends on a happier note, with ""Optimism, Joy, Gentility,"" and such wonderful works as Helen Keller's The Story of My Life, Shaw's Pygmalion, Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon, and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.      Illustrated throughout with imaginative paper cut-out murals by artist Diana Bryan, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century is a reflection of our times, featuring both the books we love--whether The Cat in the Hat or Ulysses--and books like The Surgeon General's Report or Mein Kampf that, for better or worse, have been an inescapable part of our century. ""For 100 years, the librarians of The New York Public Library have shared our passion for books with a diverse and literate public,"" said curator and editor Elizabeth Diefendorf. ""That experience has given us a unique perspective in making our choices for the books of the century. We hoped that visitors to the exhibition, and now the readers of this book, will be drawn into our choices and reflect on what their own selections would be."""

616,"Brilliant inspiration from some of our most renowned and respected fiction writers on the craft of writing and the writing life. ""Abandon the idea that you are ever going to finish . . . write just one page for each day. . . . Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down,"" instructs John Steinbeck. ""When your interest is engaged, i.e., in the sounds and smells of your city, you write admirably. But until these details become the envelope of a clear and legible emotion, ambition, or dilemma, the reader's interest, while respectful, will be to some extent merely polite,"" writes John Updike to Nicholas Delbanco. Andre Dubus reflects, ""I learned from Hemingway to stop each day's work in mid-sentence, while it is still going well, then to exercise the body, and not to think about the story till you go to your desk each day."" Tobias Wolff muscles a student who does not take his craft or talent seriously enough. Ray Bradbury encourages a young writer not to take the academic route. Rosellen Brown, Ann Beattie, and Joyce Carol Oates give the reader tactics for surviving the writing life. As Frederick Busch says in his introduction to this collection, ""this is a book of counsel and sustenance. . . . The readers of this book are about to receive the wisdom of those who know, from the inside of the process, what a writer might need, from time to time, to hear."""

The result is a body of work that is extraordinarily rich, hard to keep up with, and extremely difficult to teach.With the appearance of Theorizing Feminism: Parallel Trends in the Humanities and Social Sciences, the first genuinely interdisciplinary anthology of significant contributions to feminist theory, teachers will finally have a volume that does justice to their topic. Creatively edited, with insightful introductory material, this timely reader illuminates the historical development of feminist theory as well as the current state of the field.Emphasizing common themes and interests in the humanities and social sciences, the editors have chosen those topics that have been central to feminist theory in many disciplines, that remain relevant to current debates, and that reflect the interests of a diverse community of thinkers.The contributors include leading figures from psychology, literary criticism, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, art history, law, and economics. This is the ideal text for any advanced course on interdisciplinary feminist theory, one that fills a long-standing gap in feminist pedagogy."

You'll think ""what if"" instead of ""what is"" in order to take control of your material and cut loose the inhibitions of real life.In these pages, you'll learn how to hone your observation skills and fill your journal with rich and vivid details. (Because, as Hemley writes, ""Life is in the details, and so is good fiction."") You'll see how to decide which ideas to bring to fiction and which ones to let go. And you'll learn how to: find the right form - novel, short story, vignette, memoir - for the story you want to tell; use ""triggers"" to start your reader's imagination rolling; keep your fiction emotionally honest by making the right choices between ""the way it happened"" and what the story dictates (ask ""Is it believable?"", not ""Did it happen?""); create composites of real people and places that fit the unique needs of your story and empower your imagination; focus your fiction. Make sure everything, every character counts - and eliminate ""people who sit at the end of the bar without a role to play""; fictionalize - ethically and legally - other people's stories. Learn your rights as a writer versus their rights to privacy. (Can you use actual names? When do you need to get permission?)To illustrate how writers feed their fiction with reality, Hemley uses examples from his own work and from fiction masters of yesterday and today. At the end of each chapter, challenging exercises help you apply the basic theories and push them even further.An adventurous read, Turning Life Into Fiction will help you create fiction that's just as strange and wonderful and ""real"" as the life that inspires it."

627,"Nothing is more exciting than the appearance of a new writer on the scene, opening new vistas on to a previously untraveled terrain. Roberto Quesada, the youngest and freshest new voice from Latin America, has been hailed by Latin American critics as ""one of our most talented and original new writers"" (Ramon Luis Acevedo) and "":.. among the most important latin American writers"" (German Vargas).A novel of Central America, The Ships describes the occasional triumphs of daily life, usually in the form of silent laughter in a world of near poverty. It charts the progress of a young writer named Guillermo in the Honduran coastal town of La Ceiba. His nights alternate between falling deeply in love and loveless sexual escapades. His days are spent harvesting pineapples under a hot sun in the employ of the Standard Fruit Company. In the background there is a workers' strike at the plantation, a dance in La Ceiba, radio reports of the revolution going on in Nicaragua only a few hours' drive south, and the drone of American helicopters overhead. Quesada's world is topsy-turvy only in the sense that here human values of love and friendship dwarf the ostensibly much-larger corporate, military, and geopolitical issues."

646,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb provides a unique perspective on the twentieth century through a lively collection of writings about the unexpected and paradoxical ways in which technology has changed our lives -- and will affect our future.  Technology has been the blessing and the bane of the twentieth century. Human lifespan has nearly doubled in the West, but in no century have more human beings ever been killed by new technologies of war. Improvements in agriculture have fed increasing billions, but pesticides and chemicals threaten to poison the Earth.  Does technology improve us or diminish us? Enslave us or make us free? The problems and paradoxes of technology have stirred impassioned debate, yet, despite the central role technology has played in this century, Visions of Technology is the first book to explore the rich diversity of commentary about this vital subject.  Guided by the eminent Richard Rhodes, the reader of this provocative treasury will find highlighted the views of such prominent technological figures as Henry Ford, H. G. Wells, Rachel Carson, Margaret Sanger, Aldous Huxley, John Glenn and Gordon E. Moore. Visions of Technology also features thought-provoking images -- from the first X ray to R. Crumb's comic apocalypse -- which inform this original, much-needed roundtable.  Among the gems of opinion and history of technology gathered in this volume are Henry Ford on the horseless carriage, Thorstein Veblen on the discipline of the machine, David McCullough on the Panama Canal, Billy Mitchell on air warfare, Margaret Sanger on birth control, Robert Caro on Robert Moses, Charles Lindbergh on flying, James Agee on overalls, Lieutenant General Leslie R.

648,"Bainbridge's brilliantly imagined, universally acclaimed, Booker Prize-longlisted novel portrays the inordinate appetites and unrequited love touched off when the most celebrated man of eighteenth-century English letters, Samuel Johnson, enters the domain of a wealthy Southwark brewer and his wife, Hester Thrale. The melancholic, middle-aged lexicographer plunges into an increasingly ambiguous relationship with the vivacious Mrs. Thrale for the next twenty years. In that time Hester's eldest daughter, the neglected but prodigiously clever Queeney, will grow into young womanhood. Along the way, little of the emotional tangle and sexual tension stirring beneath the decorous surfaces of the Thrale household will escape Queeney's cold, observant eye.

651,"This is the story of one man's faith, told with unrivaled reflection and candor. William F. Buckley, Jr., was raised a Catholic. As the world plunged into war, and as social mores changed dramatically around him, Buckley's faith -- a most essential part of his make-up -- sustained him. In Nearer, My God, Buckley examines in searching detail the meaning of his faith, and how his life has been shaped and sustained by religious conviction.In highly personal terms, and with the wit and acuity for which he is justly renowned, Buckley discusses vital issues of Catholic doctrine and practice, and in so doing outlines for the reader both the nature of CathoLic faith and the essential role of religious belief in everyday life. In powerfully felt prose, he contributes provocatively and intelligently to the national interest in the nature of religion, the Church, and spiritual development. Nearer, My God is sure to appeal to all readers who have felt the stirrings of their own religious faith, and who want confirmation of their beliefs or who are seeking a guide to understanding their own souls. The renowned social and political commentator, William F. Buckley Jr., turns to a highly personal subject -- his faith. And he tells us the story of his life as a Catholic Christian. ""Nearer, My God"" is the most reflective, poignant, and searching of Bill Buckley's many books. In the opening chapters he relives his childhood, a loving, funny, nostalgic glimpse into pre-World War II America and England. He speaks about his religious experiences to a world that has changed dramatically. He is unafraid of revealing the most personal side of his faith. He describes, in his distinctive style, the intimacy of a trip to Lourdes, the impact on him of the searing account by Maria Valtorta of the Crucifixion, the ordination of his nephew into the priesthood, and gives a moving account of his mother's death. And there is humor, as Buckley gives a unique, hilarious view of a visit to the Vatican with Malcolm Muggeridge, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, and David Niven. Personal though this book is, Buckley has gone to others to examine new perspectives, putting together his own distinguished 'Forum' and leaning on the great literature of the past to illustrate his thinking on contemporary Catholic and Christian issues."
652,"Many Jewish men and women are creating a vibrant, enriched Judaism for our contemporary world. Psychologist and bestselling author Samuel Osherson shines a light on those who are broadening the practice of Judaism: families observing the holidays at home; intermarried couples raising their children Jewish; study groups working with and without rabbis; and people inspired by their faith to creative work and charitable action. These people are widening the doors of Judaism, creating new rituals, increasing openness to other religions, and moving this patriarchal religion toward one without authoritarian figures. And here, Osherson, beginning a new chapter in the long story of the survival of the Jewish people, has provided a handbook for Jews yearning to redefine their relationship with Judaism and seeking to rebuild the bridges between their religious and cultural heritage. For the millions of assimilated, unaffiliated, or disaffected Jews who are quietly finding their way back to their religion, this book offers new approaches to an ancient tradition."
653,"To those struggling on the frontlines to save endangered plants and animals, the crucial challenge is to confront the biological causes of those species’ decline. But just as threatening to their survival are obstacles erected by human politics, greed, corruption, folly, and hypocrisy. In this mesmerizing book, Beverly and Stephen Stearns tell the stories of people who have worked directly with disappearing species in Europe, Africa, North America, and Oceania. They are stories of passion and commitment, of competence and selflessness. They are also stories that alarm, for even as unheralded heroes are working to reverse what often seems to be a species’ inevitable march toward extinction, incompetent or self-interested parties are often working against them.The authors interviewed people who work with endangered species as diverse as Mediterranean monk seals, large blue butterflies, African wild dogs, native Hawaiian crows, Texas salamanders, and rare plants on Mauritius. These dedicated individuals, in discussing how they view their work, the problems they encounter, and their thoughts on the broader significance of extinction, reveal that the causes of extinction are unique to each species—sometimes subtle and complex, at other times obvious and simple. Yet an extinction always represents an irretrievable loss of evolutionary potential and a diminishing of the beauty, diversity, and value in our own lives. The dramatic lessons of this book shed new light on the problems of endangered species and offer hope that we may yet change the fate of those species that totter on the edge of extinction."

659,"The bestselling author of Slammerkin turns her attention to the Beau Monde of late eighteenth-century England, turning the private drama of three celebrated Londoners into a robust, full-bodied portrait of a world, and lives, on the brink of revolution. The Honourable Mrs. Damer is a young widow of eccentric tastes, the only female sculptor of her time. The Earl of Derby, inventor of the horse race that bears his name, is the richest man in the House of Lords-and the ugliest. Miss Eliza Farren, born a nobody, now reigns as Queen of Comedy at Drury Lane Theatre. In a time of looming war and terrorism, of glittering spectacle and financial disasters, the wealthy liberals of the Whig Party work to topple a tyrannical prime minister and a lunatic king. Their marriages and friendships stretch or break; political liaisons prove as dangerous as erotic ones. Will Eliza Farren ever gain entry to that elite circle that calls itself the World? Can Lord Derby's pride endure public mockery of his long, unconsummated courtship of the actress? And how is Anne Damer ever to silence the whispers of Sapphism that haunt her? Let the games begin..."
660,"Acclaimed and beloved prize-winning essayist Roger Rosenblatt has commented on most of the trends and events of our time. His columns in Time magazine and his commentaries on PBS's News Hour with Jim Lehrer have made him a household word and a trusted friend of millions. With a wry sense of humor and inimitable wit, Rosenblatt offers here guidelines for aging that are both easy to understand and, more importantly, easy to implement.  More and more in the news today, we are hearing about phenomenal advances in the ""fight against aging."" But what Rosenblatt suggests to combat age is far more valuable than any scientific breakthrough-he breaks down the hardest part of aging, the mental anguish of growing older with fifty-four gems of funny, brilliant, wise, indispensable advice. A book to savor, a book to keep, and a book for all ages.This little guide is intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all. . . . One may think of this work as a how-to book, akin to many health guides published these days, whose purpose is to prolong our lives and make them richer. That is the aim of my book, too. -from the IntroductionAnd this is just the start of Roger Rosenblatt's charming and thought-provoking guide to surviving the episodes that shamelessly shave years off of our lives. With a wry sense of humor and peerless wit, Rules for Aging provides guidance that is, hands down, the most practical, pleasurable and, most importantly, painless advice you'll ever receive. As Rosenblatt writes, ""When I urge you to refrain from a certain thought or course of action, I do not mean to suggest that you are in any way wrong if you do the opposite. I mean only to say that you will suffer.""Rule #1: It doesn't matterWhatever you think matters-doesn't. Follow this rule, and it will add decades to your life. It does not matter if you are late, or early; if you are here, or if you are there; if you said it, or did not say it; if you were clever, or if you were stupid; if you are having a bad hair day, or a no hair day; if your boss looks at you cockeyed; if your girlfriend or boyfriend looks at you cockeyed; if you don't get that promotion, or prize, or house, or if you do. It doesn't matter."
661,"For anyone interested in history, the physical traces of the past, especially historical places, hold a special fascination. Whether it is a battlefield or the home of a notable American, there is no question that we understand the past in a different and more immediate way when we encounter it ""on the ground.""     In American Places, more than two dozen of America's most gifted historians write about their own encounters with historic places, bringing a personal viewpoint to bear on a wide variety of sites, ranging from Monticello to Fenway Park. Here James M. McPherson writes about the battlefield of Gettysburg, and how walking the ground of Pickett's Charge inspired one of his books. Kevin Starr visits the Musso & Frank Grill in Hollywood and finds many of the flavors of California history there. Joel Williamson takes a bemused tour of Elvis Presley's Graceland, and David Kennedy tells the story of the ""Pig War"" of San Juan Island, where a spat between Britain and America over a speck of land in the Pacific helped determine the shape of the U.S. and Canada. William Freehling compares two places, Charleston's Battery and New Orleans' Jackson Square, showing how each reveals the different spirit of the society that created it. And Edward Ayers talks about spending time in Cyberspace, U.S.A., a virtual place that has much in common with the America visited by Alexis de Tocqueville a century and a half ago. Other pieces include Robert Dallek on the FDR Memorial, David Hackett Fischer on the Boston Common, and William Leuchtenburg on his native borough of Queens.     American Places celebrates the career of Sheldon Meyer, who over his years at Oxford University Press has published some of our most distinguished historians, including many Pulitzer Prize and Bancroft Prize winners, virtually all of whom have contributed to this volume."

663,"It is 1924 - a time of rebuilding, from the slow reconstruction of Washington's most honored monuments to the reclamation of devastated cities in Europe and Canada. In the United States, the Socialist Party, led by Hosea Blackford, battles Calvin Coolidge to hold on to the Powell House in Philadelphia. And it seems as if the Socialists can do no wrong, for the stock market soars and America enioys prosperity unknown in a half century. But as old names like Custer and Roosevelt fade into history, a new generation faces new uncertainties.The Confederate States, victorious in the War of Secession and in the Second Mexican War but at last tasting defeat in the Great War, suffer poverty and natural calamity. The Freedom Party promises new strength and pride. But if its chief seizes the reins of power, he may prove a dangerous enemy for the hated U.S.A. Yet the United States take little note. Sharing world domination with Germany, they consider events in the Confederacy of little consequence.As the 1920s end, calamity casts a pall across the continent. With civil war raging in Mexico, terrorist uprisings threatening U.S. control in Canada, and an explosion of violence in Utah, the United States are rocked by uncertainty."
664,"Since the founding of the United States, war has been a recurring phenomenon in American history.  We have fought for many reasons:  independence, national unity, manifest destiny, international democracy.  Americans have fought in almost every corner of the world, from deserts to mountains to jungles.  And in every war on every front, we have paid intense attention.  Typewriter patriots, equipped with telegraphs, radio microphones, or satellite links, have been the conduit for a public eager to imagine and feel every musket fire and missile blast from Lexington to Baghdad.   In Dispatches from the Front we have unique and special dispatches from ten American wars.  In the correspondents' words ring the passion and drama of war from the American Revolution to the Persian Gulf War.  The work of Thomas Paine, Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Ernie Pyle, Edward R. Morrow, Sydney Schanberg, and more than sixty other correspondents tell us of America's wars as they happened, on the battlefield and on the home front.  Brief essays introduce each war by discussing the important changes taking place in American society and providing a series of ""national snapshots"" of the economic, political, and technological character of the world and the country at the time.  The impact of these factors on each episode of warfare is considered, followed by a focus on the experiences of the war itself.   Over the years, the words of press observers have been central in fostering wartime nationalism.  Reporters functioned as frontline poets, scratching the first impressions into the culture's consciousness. The tone and character of the press coverage shaped the nation's understanding of itself. Dispatches from the Front offers insight into the culture of the United States at each crisis point, from its beginnings to the present time."
665,"In this provocative book, John Patrick Diggins, hailed by Alan Ryan in the New York Times as “one of the liveliest and most interesting of contemporary intellectual historians,” offers a sweeping reassessment of American history, emphasizing the foundational role of Abraham Lincoln’s moral and political theory. Distressed by the divisive impact of modern identity politics, Diggins argues persuasively that in the central tenets of Lincoln’s political faith--the redeeming value of labor and the rights to property and self-determination--we find the purest expression of the values that have united Americans and guided American history.With his characteristic breadth, Diggins ranges from James Madison to W. E. B. Du Bois to the movie Good Will Hunting in his examination of the often ambivalent ways in which Americans have imagined themselves and their nation. Convinced that contemporary historians have done America a grave disservice by emphasizing political divisions along the lines of class, race, and gender, Diggins points out that throughout American history there has been more that unites the American people than divides them."

676,"""Instead of proposing another theory of war, their goal is a more modest one of raising the theoretical consciousness of historians. Specifically, they argue that &#39;1) ideology does influence theory, 2) historians do have ideologies as well as theories . . . about which they are not always conscious or consistent, and 3) we can better understand, compare, and evaluate what historians are saying when we comprehend their ideological and theoretical perspectives.&#39; They attempt then, to classify historical interpretations of war according to their ideological/ theoretical orientations, however covert."" --Perspective ""Nelson and Olin .. . are concerned with enhancing history&#39;s social utility by advancing its capacity to produce generalizations that can explain or predict events and are subject to empirical testing. Their exploration of historical generalization focuses on an issue itself of the highest importance, the causes of war; but their aim is also to create a model for historical generalization applicable to other issues. They argue that to understand generalizations in history, one must recognize their roots in theory, and that historians&#39; theories in turn proceed from their own ideologies. To demonstrate, they survey theories about the causes of war that have come out of conservative, liberal, and radical ideologies. . . . any historian will profit from this rigorous approach to the problem."" --Choice ""Learned and suggestive, this book clarifies much of what is already known, and points toward new ways of understanding.""--Library Journal"

681,"""Mommy, why can`t the doctors make you better?""...""You won`t be there, will you? Who`ll take care of me?""—Rachel, age 5 AIDS breaks the rules of dying. It strikes the young rather than the old, decimating families and devastating communities. It will leave as its legacy a generation of orphans—traumatized by multiple losses, isolation, stigma, and grief. By the turn of the century, more than a hundred thousand children and youth in the United States—and ten million worldwide—will lose their parents to AIDS.Written by professionals in medicine, law, social work, anthropology, psychiatry, and public policy, this volume is the first full-length look at the issues facing children whose parents and siblings are dying of AIDS: what children experience, how it affects them, how we can meet their emotional needs and help them find second families, how we counter the stigmas they face. Authors explore ways to promote resilience in these AIDS-affected children. Stories of the children and their caretakers, told in their own words, are woven throughout.Pioneering and practical, the book presents an action agenda and resource directory for our nation`s policymakers as well as for parents and those who work with children in both formal and informal settings.

683,"One of the most beloved novels in recent years, Plainsong was a best-seller from coast to coast—and now Kent Haruf returns to the High Plains community of Holt, Colorado, with a story of even more masterful authority.When the McPheron brothers see Victoria Roubideaux, the single mother they’d taken in, move from their ranch to begin college, an emptiness opens before them—and for many other townspeople it also promises to be a long, hard winter. A young boy living alone with his grandfather helps out a neighbor whose husband, off in Alaska, suddenly isn’t coming home, leaving her to raise their two daughters. At school the children of a disabled couple suffer indignities that their parents know all too well in their own lives, with only a social worker to look after them and a violent relative to endanger them further. But in a small town a great many people encounter one another frequently, often surprisingly, and destinies soon become entwined—for good and for ill—as they confront events that sorely test the limits of their resilience and means, with no refuge available except what their own character and that of others afford them. Spring eventually does reach across the land, and how the people of Eventide get there makes for an engrossing, profoundly moving novel rich in the wisdom, humor, and humanity for which Kent Haruf is justly acclaimed."

686,"A widely respected ecological scientist and activist draws on the poet's image and his own environmental research to demonstrate the many interconnections among the world's ecosystems. John Harte takes us from Alaskan salmon runs and the Florida everglades to South Pacific coral reefs and the bleak Tibetan plateau. The result is that rare book that bridges the cultures of science and art. Lyrical, vivid portraits of natural wonders and the threats to them are combined with precise scientific accounts of natural processes and their disturbances. The Green Fuse will show nonscientists the fascination of ecological detective work and renew scientists' love for the beauty of the world under their microscopes.Harte's stories illuminate, without sermonizing, the damage to natural systems brought about by technological hubris and calculated political ruthlessness. ""The green fuse"" symbolizes the basic unity behind natural diversity. But a fuse may also be the weak link in an overloaded system or the slow burning wick on an ecological bomb. As The Green Fuse reminds us, the energies that created human liberation from nature can also be those that lead to the human destruction of nature."

689,"Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman in the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected in 1968. That was nearly a hundred years after the election of the first African American man to Congress and fifty years after the first woman. A quarter of a century after Chisholm's election, the first Black woman, Carol Moseley-Braun, was elected to the United States Senate. It was not until 1993, when ten additional Black women won seats in the 103rd Congress, that African American women were allowed to serve their country and their constituencies in any substantial numbers. In 1997 that historic moment will very likely be lost as congressional districts are redrawn by court order. This remarkable book by LaVerne Gill preserves the history of the struggles and accomplishments of these fifteen courageous women, and will move others to learn from and follow their example.African American Women in Congress details the life and career histories of Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, Yvonne Burke, Cardiss Collins, Katie Hall, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Maxine Waters, Barbara-Rose Collins, Carol Moseley-Braun, Corinne Brown, Carrie Meek, Cynthia McKinney, Eva Clayton, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Sheila Jackson-Lee. Each profile contains a picture of its subject, interview material, and resumés. Arranged chronologically, the book introduces the reader to issues of vital importance to the Black community—Reconstruction, enfranchisement, lynchings and harassment, civil rights struggles, the founding of advocacy groups, the power of the Congressional Black Caucus, the creation of majority minority districts that allowed greater representation in Congress, the struggle of largely Black Washington, D.C., for representation, and the recent dismantling of past gains by a Republican majority. Gill also describes the uphill battles for social justice and the rights of women that the fifteen women had to wage even within their own political parties, political organizations, and districts.For general readers, high school and college students, and anyone interested in the political process, this book is illuminating and inspiring reading."
690,"In 1925, Edwin A. Alderman, president of the University of Virginia, fulfilled a long-held dream by establishing a magazine at the institution founded by Thomas Jefferson just over one hundred years earlier. Not only did Alderman initiate publication of the Virginia Quarterly Review, he contributed an essay to its inaugural issue.Appearing as the first selection in this new volume of nonfiction from the VQR, Alderman's ""Edgar Allan Poe and the University of Virginia"" reflects the rare combination of literary sensibility and immersion in the political and social issues of the day, which has characterized the journal throughout its seventy-five-year history. As Alderman writes, ""I may be frank and say that there was a time when Poe did not greatly appeal to me. I felt the sheer, clear beauty of his song..., but his detachment from the world of men, where my interests most centered, left me unresponsive and simply curious.... I have come, however, to see the limitations of that view, and to behold something admirable and strange and wonderful in this proud, gifted man.""While the style and diction of the contributions have changed in the years since that first spring issue, a similar clarity of thought, deep intelligence, candor, and command of language can be found in every one of the fifty one essays assembled here by Alexander Burnham. From its home at One West Range, a few doors down from Poe's own room, the VQR has welcomed to its pages scholars such as Dumas Malone and Robert Coles, and writers whose books have become international bestsellers, including Arthur C. Clarke and Frances Mayes.Included here are some of the twentieth century's most brilliant thinkers and stylists, such international literary, political, and intellectual figures as Andre Gide, D. H. Lawrence, Aldous Huxley, Evelyn Waugh, T. S. Eliot, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Mann, Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, and Robert Graves. George F. Kennan muses on ""The Experience of Writing History,"" Henry Steele Commager asks ""Do We Have a Class Society?,"" and Edmund S. Morgan considers the aloof character of George Washington. Carlos Baker tracks Ezra Pound through Venice, and Scott Donaldson ponders ""The Jilting of Ernest Hemingway."" These leading lights share space, as they do in every volume of the journal, with lesser-known but no less talented writers ruminating on the Battle of the Bulge, the Berlin Wall, the Bomb, and Vietnam, on growing up in Hollywood and living in Charlottesville, Virginia.Writers of the South are fittingly represented by Thomas Wolfe, Mary Lee Settle, and Louis D. Rubin Jr., but a quick scan of the table of contents reveals that the VQR has never been a regional magazine. As the current editor, Staige D. Blackford writes in his preface, ""Since its inception, the Virginia Quarterly Review has tried to offer its readers a variety of essays on a variety of topics ranging from foreign affairs to domestic politics, from literature to travel, from sports to sex, from music to medicine.""On the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary, We Write for Our Own Time amply and entertainingly reflects what the VQR's masthead has always proclaimed as its identity: ""A National Journal of Literature and Discussion."""
691,"Takes readers whale watching, glacier viewing, and visiting the town of Cordova in the wake of the great Exxon Valdez oil spill. More than a scenic tour, it offers observations of the Aleuts by a Russian Orthodox priest, remembrances of changing lifeways by a young Eskimo, and recollections of the first white explorers by a 120-year-old Athabaskan woman. It features contributions by visiting naturalists John Muir and Edward Hoagland, literary views from John Dos Passos, and contributions by native Alaskans whose names are not as well known but who know their land and their neighbors as no outsider can."
692,"New in paperbackRevised and expandedDuring the tumultuous 1990s, as Russia struggled to shed the trappings of the Soviet empire, television viewing emerged as an enormous influence on Russian life. The number of viewers who routinely watch the nightly news in Russia matches the number of Americans who tune in to the Super Bowl, thus making TV coverage the prized asset for which political leaders intensely—and sometimes violently—compete. In this revised and expanded edition of Changing Channels, Ellen Mickiewicz provides many fascinating insights, describing the knowing ways in which ordinary Russians watch the news, skeptically analyze information, and develop strategies for dealing with news bias.	 Covering the period from the state-controlled television broadcasts at the end of the Soviet Union through the attempted coup against Gorbachev, the war in Chechnya, the presidential election of 1996, and the economic collapse of 1998, Mickiewicz draws on firsthand research, public opinion surveys, and many interviews with key players, including Gorbachev himself. By examining the role that television has played in the struggle to create political pluralism in Russia, she reveals how this struggle is both helped and hindered by the barrage of information, advertisements, and media-created personalities that populate the airwaves. Perhaps most significantly, she shows how television has emerged as the sole emblem of legitimate authority and has provided a rare and much-needed connection from one area of this huge, crisis-laden country to the next. 	This new edition of Changing Channels will be valued by those interested in Russian studies, politics, media and communications, and cultural studies, as well as general readers who desire an up-to-date view of crucial developments in Russia at the end of the twentieth century."
693,"Written with the same acerbic wit and infectious humor that has made P. J. O'Rourke one of the most popular political satirists of all time, The Enemies List will keep you howling and his enemies scowling. From Noam Chomsky to Yoko Ono, from Peter, Paul, and Mary (yes, they're still alive) to all the people who think quartz crystals cure herpes, from Ralph Nader to the entire country of Sweden, P. J. O'Rourke has created a roster of the most useless, politically disgraceful, and downright foolish people around. Although a rating system of S=Silly, VS=Very Silly, SML=Shirley MacLaine was ultimately cast aside, the distinguishing feature of the cluster of dunces presented here is silliness, not political subversion. The Enemies List began as an article in the American Spectator and, as readers contributed their own suggestions, quickly grew into a hilarious and slashing commentary on politicians and celebrities alike. Now they have been named, we just need to figure out what to do with them. ""To say that P. J. O'Rourke is funny is like saying that the Rocky Mountains are scenic - accurate but insufficient."" - Chicago Tribune"
694,"Kurt Wolff (1887-1963) was a singular presence in the literary world of the twentieth century, a cultural force shaping modern literature itself and pioneering significant changes in publishing. During an intense, active career that spanned two continents and five decades, Wolff launched seven publishing houses and nurtured an extraordinary array of writers, among them Franz Kafka, Lou Andreas-Salomé, Boris Pasternak, Günter Grass, Robert Musil, Paul Valéry, Julian Green, Lampedusa, and Anne Morrow Lindbergh."

Sue Rosser critiques male-focused medical research and health care practice and explores how medical education could make women's health and well-being share the attention of the medical profession."
696,"An original account, revolutionary in technique, examining the character of the great Romantic poet Lord Byron through the lives and deadly rivalry of the two women he left behind.The heart of David Crane's account is the lifelong feud between Augusta - Byron's half sister with whom he had a passionate affair - and Annabella, his society wife, both of whom bore him daughters. Crane reimagines the famous meeting between the two women years after Byron's death, a chillingly dramatic scene through which he explores the emotional and sexual truths that lay at the center of these tragic relationships. In the encounter between the two women - one in chronic ill health, the other dying - we have the ultimate display of their mutual obsession with the memory and compulsive influence of Byron that makes their story that of the Romantic Age itself.It is a story full of dubious motives, especially Annabella's ""saving"" of Augusta and her child, Medora, and her twisted revenge on them both. And as the curses of incest and abuse play themselves out in the fates of Byron's daughters, we see their lives assuming the shape of Greek tragedy.In the meeting of the two women and the consequences of their battle, Crane shows us the Romantic Age in its terrible collision with the new world of the Victorians. The Kindness of Sisters establishes Crane as a biographer of formidable gifts."
697,"Economist Paul Krugman analyzes the Bush and other tax proposals, showing who wins, who loses, and how quickly the tax cuts will consume the surplus. He argues that although the tax cut might not be a matter of economic life or death, it has become a central political issue that has a distorting effect on the debate on other issues and discourages crusaders from telling the truth about their own proposals. He also maintains that reporters and TV commentators don't understand the basics about the federal government and that they, together with politicians, have confused the public. Annotation c.

701,"A New York Times Notable Book of the YearTwenty-five years ago, after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, Gerald Ford promised a return to normalcy. “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Ford declared. But it was not. The Watergate scandal, and the remedies against future abuses of power, would have an enduring impact on presidents and the country. In Shadow, Bob Woodward takes us deep into the administrations of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton to describe how each discovered that the presidency was forever altered. With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive. Shadow is an authoritative, unsettling narrative of the modern, beleaguered presidency."
702,"On May 18, 1985, pursued by a heavy spring rain, Leslie Sike's meticulously crafted steel cutter, Aqua Star, slipped out of Toronto's harbor on the first leg of the voyage to Churchill, Manitoba, on the western shore of the treacherous Hudson Bay. Sike, an adventurer with a yearning to make the record books, had discovered that since Hudson himself, only oceangoing tankers and fishing trawlers had plowed through the bay's wind-whipped and iceberg-studded expanses. He vowed to be the first to sail across the bay, and so began Aqua Star's sub-Arctic adventure.Sike and his wife, Carolann, whose sailing experiences went no further than dinghy lessons on Calgary's Glenmore Reservoir and correspondence courses on navigation, dedicated all of their energy and resources to making their unlikely dream come true. As Sike completed the building of the 41-foot steel yacht, Carolann set out to attract media attention and sponsorship. They found an eager crew in Gay Currie, an experienced sailor who signed on as cook, and David Farr, a nonsailor who undertook to photograph the voyage.For the outdoor enthusiast, Something Worth Doing is an exciting and unusually candid adventure story that records, in the sailors' own words, their exceptional journey, and captures, in vivid full-color photographs, the remote beauty of northern Canada."

705,"""How did we become the way we are?"" The question that haunts Christa Wolf's autobiographical work Patterns of Childhood has prompted many other writers and filmmakers to examine their identities as postwar German women. In one of the first books to address the New German Cinema from a feminist perspective, Barbara Kosta looks closely at two autobiographical films; Helma Sanders-Brahms's Germany, Pale Mother and Jutta Bruckner's Years of Hunger, and at two books, Ruth Rehmann's Der Mann auf der Kanzel: Fragen an einen Vater (The man in the pulpit: Questions for a father,) and Wolf's Patterns of Childhood. In different ways, Kosta shows, these works of the 1970s and 1980s have recast traditional autobiography, offering fresh characters in new roles exploring innovative forms of expression, and confronting long-repressed themes such as the devaluation of the female voice and the horror of Germany's fascist past.Kosta perceives in autobiographies by German women a conflict between the need to accept their sociocultural heritage and the desire to uncover and respond to its destructive aspects. As they struggle to redefine relationships among family, history, and self, Wolf and Rehmann write of the psychic structures, that were shaped by a childhood under the Third Reich in their films, Sanders-Brahms and Bruckner, who grew up after the war, explore issues of gender relations as well as re-enacting German history. For all four, Kosta demonstrates, autobiography is at once a process of remembering and working through national and personal trauma, a task of mourning and healing, and an act of self-invention."

What's it like to knock on a crack-house door, service revolver drawn, not knowing who - or what - is behind it? What's it like, heart pounding in your chest, to stare down the barrel of a gun pointed straight at you by a murderously high suspect?Cop shows you what it's like. It's the explosive story of Sergeant Michael Middleton, a now-retired veteran of the LAPD and survivor of what may be the most brutal urban war zone in the country. From handling the call to his first homicide as a rookie cop to making his last collar, Middleton's story is a nerve-shattering, eyewitness account of life on America's meanest streets. In his two decades on the force, he investigated more than 20,000 felony crimes, was at the scene of nearly 600 murders - including those of five officers killed in the line of duty - and made over 3,000 arrests.In Cop, Middleton writes urgently and knowingly of those years on the streets. It's a pulse-quickening - and often heartbreaking - insider's view of life as a foot soldier in America's war on crime. With the threat of violence never far away, Middleton and his fellow officers daily faced drug dealers, desperate addicts, thieves, gun-crazy gangs, rapists, and murderers. And in telling the riveting stories of these encounters, Middleton uses them to make larger points - which will often surprise and shock you - about good, evil, heroism, racism, and more.Gripping, poignant, and brutally honest, Cop is an unforgettable portrait of life as a police officer on urban America's mean and gritty streets."

717,"Athenais de Montespan reigned as official mistress to Louis XIV during the most glorious period of ""the splendid century."" As lovely and charming as she was witty and cunning, Athenais quickly rose to far greater prominence than the King's own spouse. It was Madame de Montespan who was known as ""the real Queen of France,"" the symbol of the apotheosis of French culture in the seventeenth century. As a lover, she risked the disgrace of adultery to conduct an affair that scandalized Europe; as a patron, she supported many of the leaders of the cultural renaissance; as a mother, she is the ancestor of most of the royal houses of Europe.In her superb new biography, Lisa Hilton chronicles the life of this extraordinary woman. She vividly describes Athenais's unhappy marriage to a gamester nobleman, her entry into the decadent and intricate world of court politics, and her brilliant seduction of France's most desired suitor, the King himself. Athenais transformed Louis from a shy, awkward young monarch into the polished Sun King of legend.Throughout the ""age Montespan,"" Athenais used her wit and beauty to stave off the intrigues of courtiers, the machinations of Versaille's clerics, and the wiles of lovely young pretenders to the King's heart - all doggedly seeking to unseat her. It was not until the Affair of the Poisons, a bizarre witch-hunt that uncovered conspiracy in the highest echelons of the nobility, that Athenais's hold on the King and court faltered. Though the mystery remains unsolved, Athenais's implication in the sinister dealings of sorcerers and poisoners caused a fall from grace almost as precipitous as her rise."

736,"Overly emotional, hysterical, dependent, frivolous, fickle... Why have women been so consistently defined as deficient in maturity, self-mastery, and independence according to the models of human development inspired by male culture? The authors of WOMEN'S GROWTH IN CONNECTION, a sampling of the influential working papers from the Stone Center, Wellesley College, have sought to answer this question by studying developmental theory and reformulating it to reflect women's experience more accurately. These papers, about women's ways of being in the world, frame an innovative relational perspective on women's psychological development. The authors--clinicians, clinical supervisors, and teachers--have been searching for therapeutic models that take into account women's meaning systems, values, and organization of experiences, all of which often revolves around relationships rather than the self. By offering a new perspective on women's development, WOMEN'S GROWTH IN CONNECTION stands at the forefront of the ongoing feminist movement to examine and reshape psychological theory and practice. The authors offer this volume as an invitation to the reader to join in the building of new models of women's development."
737,"The acclaimed author of Righteous Pilgrim delivers this dramatic account of the Great Depression as seen by those who lived through it. Less concerned with the power brokers in Washington than with the daily struggles of ordinary people at the grass roots, The Hungry Years draws on little-known oral histories, memoirs, local press, and scholarly monographs to capture the voices of Americans in a time of unprecedented crisis. The result is narrative history at its best: a comprehensive single volume that traces the stages of the disaster chronologically without losing touch with the wounds it inflicted or the ways people responded. Humane and compassionate, historically sound, full of story and anecdote, The Hungry Years puts the reader at the very heart of the maelstrom that was the American Depression."
738,"The human brain is astonishingly different from the brain of any other animal. Why? Have we somehow fooled Mother Nature and escaped from the laws of evolution?Written like a detective story, this book brings together a wealth of new research from paleontology, genetics, and neurobiology to explain the runaway evolution of the human brain. Evolutionists and human paleontologists have tended to assume that our intellect began to burgeon when our ancestors developed the ability to walk upright, to grasp and carry objects, or to form cooperative groups for hunting. While these and many other factors are important, this book shows that they are only some of the latest steps in a long evolutionary story that began a billion years ago. By now, the brains of many different animals are much larger than those of their predecessors and are superbly adapted to environments that have slowly become more complex. But our own distant ancestors were the only ones to enter a new evolutionary path, a feedback loop that involved their brains, their bodies, and an ever more complicated environment that they largely created themselves. The result, for better and sometimes for worse, is our own astonishing species.The author shows how this view of our evolution as a runaway process casts light on a number of major questions that recent discoveries have raised about our past. These include the identity and true role of the mitochondrial Eve, the origin of human diversity, and the confusion and controversy surrounding our fossil record. Two major views of recent human evolution hinge on the time at which people like ourselves first arose. Did they do so in several different parts of the Old World, the so-called ""multiple origins"" model, or did they appear suddenly and recently, perhaps driving all the more primitive hominids to extinction? The first model is favored by many anthropologists; the second, by many geneticists. While it is not yet possible to decide with certainty between the two, the book details how the driving force of runaway brain evolution is so great that it can easily account for multiple origins.Turning to the evolution of the brain itself, the author recounts the escape of our ancestors from the ""stupidworlds"" of the past. He shows how, as a result of this escape, our brains have evolved into sponges for knowledge. They are so versatile, and have been driven by such strong evolutionary pressures, that fundamental human capabilities such as language can be traced to many different parts of the brain that have simultaneously increased in complexity. Using a vivid series of examples, the book details scientists' growing knowledge of the kinds of genetic changes that have powered the runaway process.Written by a scientist whose previous books have explored the whole sweep of evolution and the complexities of the human genome, The Runaway Brain casts a brilliant light on human intellect and human nature."

740,"This definitive anthology is the fruit of one of America’s most respected neoconservatives. Trained in Christian ethics, Ernest Lefever has been an articulate public policy advocate. Both conservatives and liberals will ignore his views at their peril.In this first-ever anthology of his most important work, Lefever takes a bold and lively march through the second half of the twentieth century. As an acute participant-observer who cares deeply about peace, freedom, and human dignity, Lefever became a neoconservative twenty years before Irving Kristol coined the term. For this volume, Lefever selected forty of his most influential essays from some 500 published pieces. They reveal his dramatic transformation from a liberal pacifist during World War II to a humane realist.The earliest essays, from Lefever’s Yale Divinity School days, recount his experience as a civil rights activist during World War II and as a relief worker in the POW camps of postwar Europe. Later essays assess such institutions as the United Nations and the World Council of Churches. Lefever tackles a myriad policy issues from nuclear testing and human rights to arms control and the collapse of communism. His essays on the Berlin Wall and his reappraisal of the Vietnam legacy confirm his skill at combining history, political theory, and opinion journalism. An introductory autobiographical sketch vividly portrays Lefever’s spiritual and political pilgrimage."

The book reveals the high cost to the U.S. military of acute political instability in Eastern Europe, the economic impact on U.S. businesses of systemic corruption in East Asia, the serious worldwide environmental hazards of nuclear fuel leaks in Russia, the imminent threat of deadly viruses spreading from Africa, and even the expensive consequences of substandard prison conditions in the United States, to name some examples. At the heart of each of these problems lies the abuse of basic human rights. Through these stories, Schulz builds a powerful case for defending our own interests by vigorously defending the human rights of people everywhere.""If any foreign policy primer could be called a page-turner, it is this one by the executive director of Amnesty International USA. What the human rights community needs to do, argues Schulz in this well-written clarion call, is find 'the compelling reasons why respect for human rights is in the best interests of the United States.' . . . Schulz has written a clear and provocative book that should be read by all concerned with human rights and U.S. foreign policy and will draw new supporters among the general public."" —Publishers Weekly, Starred Review ""In such a climate, William F. Schulz, a former UUA president and current executive director of Amnesty International USA, has written a smart, detailed and compelling book about the urgency of the human rights movement. In Our Own Best Interest: How Defending Human Rights Benefits All Americans strikes at the core of existing notions of national self-interest by making the case that if we value our own lives and futures, we will pay serious attention to upholding human rights everywhere on earth. . . . In writing In Our Own Best Interests, Schulz has given new life and strength to the reality of our interdependence."" —World"
745,"In a single year, Dr. David Gunn was killed, Jane Roe recanted, the Supreme Court began to backpedal from its landmark 1973 decision, Congress became fixated on a rare late-term abortion procedure, and numerous states imposed legislation limiting a woman’s right to choose. It was a year of extremes for an issue that seems to know no middle ground, and it is the polarizing quality of abortion as a policymaking dilemma that No Neutral Ground? seeks to address.One of the most heated and often violent issues of our time, abortion continues to challenge leaders, citizens, and policymakers alike. Is it a question of morality? Personal liberty? The right to privacy? Keeping the peace? What are the implications of the Supreme Court’s rulings on abortion for future legislation? And what does it mean for every level of government when an issue defies consensus the way that abortion does?In her unique treatment of this complex subject, Karen O’Connor builds on the history of abortion as a political issue—how it was first defined in the early 1800s and how it got on the political agenda—and takes us through the tug-of-war development of abortion politics to the present, using the policy process framework. Examining key court cases, institutions, dramatic events, and opinions from the public to the Supreme Court, O’Connor highlights the dilemma of how a polity attempts to make decisions about issues on which agreement or compromise is unlikely. She questions whether such divisive issues can ever be satisfactorily resolved, but gives us the tools to explore every avenue toward potential resolution."
746,"In 1925 Earl May began broadcasting KMA Radio-960 from Shenandoah,  Iowa, to boost his fledgling seed business. The station aired practical  information designed to help with the day-to-day activity in midwestern  farmhouse kitchens. Before long KMA was a trusted friend throughout the  wide listening area, offering inspiration, companionship, and all  manners of domestic counsel. Hosting the daily radio programs—Home Hour,  the Stitch and Chat Club, and the KMA Party Line—and the live cooking  demonstrations that drew thousands to the KMA auditorium was a changing  roster of personable, lively women who quickly became known as the KMA  Radio Homemakers.Now, in Neighboring on the Air, we can hear the voices  of the KMA homemakers and sample their philosophy and—best of  all—cooking. Through recipes, biographies, and household advice we get  to know such enduring women as ""The Little Minister,"" the Reverend  Edythe Stirlen, and Leanna Driftmier and the whole Kitchen-Klatter  family, part of the longest-running homemaker program in the history of  radio. Learn how to make Sour Cream Apple Pie from ""The Farmer's Wife,""  Florence Falk; Varnished Chicken from the first long-term KMA Radio  Homemaker, Jessie Young; and E.E.E. Missouri Dessert (nobody can  remember what the ""E.E.E."" stands for) from the indomitable host of the  Edith Hansen Kitchen Club. This endearing scrapbook of people, places,  and foods charts the continuing adventure of the KMA homemakers as they  broadcast into the 1990s. Neighboring on the Air is an  enchanting piece of Americana. Anyone interested in cooking, cultural  history, or the Midwest will want to own and use this book."
747,"Hollywood, Walter Winchell quipped, is where they shoot too many movies and not enough actors. Always looking for an angle, always, scheming, always the scene of clashing egos, the movie industry is where they place you under contract instead of observation--and if you don't have anything nice to say, write it down. ""In 1940, I had my choice between Hitler and Hollywood,"" French director René Clair recalled, ""and I preferred Hollywood--just a little.""In Movie Anecdotes, Peter Hay treats us to a delightful ride through the world that has captivated audiences for almost a century, with stories that are often hilarious, sometimes tragic, and always entertaining. He takes us from the rough-and tumble early days (when one studio paid Pancho Villa $25,000 to launch his attacks only in daylight, after a film crew had set up) to the studio era (when Joan Crawford refused to cross the street on the MGM lot except in a chauffeured limousine) to the shenanigans of today's global industry. Here are stories about all the legends: Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Mae West, Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Judy Garland, Sophia Loren, John Wayne, and, of course, Ronald Reagan. There are the great directors from D.W. Griffith, Hitchcock, and Eisenstein, to Kurosawa, Bergman, Visconti, Huston, Ford, and Woody Allen. And Hay has selected tales of the writers, the wits, and the grand moguls, including perhaps the largest collection of Goldwynisms--both genuine and apocryphal.Along with the laughter, this volume recreates the conflicts that have torn the movie world, from battles over money and contracts, to discrimination, divorces, and scandals. Colorful, incredible, bitter, funny--the stories about moviemaking are as fantastic as the pictures themselves. Now they have been gathered together in an irresistible bouquet that is certain to delight every movie buff and provide fascinating insights for serious students of film."

749,"For nearly a decade Barbara Parker's phenomenally successful thrillers have delighted readers and reviewers alike. The Chicago Tribune applauds her ""taut storytelling...tight plotting and lively characterization."" The Miami Herald hails her for her ""well-paced, compelling stories and believable characters with emotional depth and texture that should turn casual readers into fanatics."" And the San Antonio Express-News calls her novels simply ""enthralling."" Now this supremely gifted author returns with a blockbuster story of smoldering suspense that pits Gail and Anthony against their most chilling adversary yet.  For attorneys Gail Connor and Anthony Quintana, spending a couple of days in a private villa on a secluded island in the Florida Keys seems almost too good to be true. The innocent cliché hits home with a vengeance when a dangerously unbalanced former client of Anthony's is suspected of a local murder, and then attempts suicide. As an idyllic vacation turns into an escalating nightmare of terror and death, Gail and Anthony find themselves isolated among the strange and secretive islanders as a late tropical storm threatens to unleash its fury on them all. Somehow, they must hang on to their sanity and use every weapon at their disposal to outwit a wily criminal bent on plunging them into a world of deepening madness.  Filled with steamy atmosphere, stunning reversals, and hairpin twists and turns, and certain to be another sensational bestseller, Suspicion of Madness is Barbara Parker-one of America's best thriller authors writing today-at the top of her game."
750,"Contemporary reporter Sam Fowler, stuck in a dull job and a failing marriage, abruptly finds himself transported back to the summer of 1869. After a wrenching period of adjustment, he comes to feel rejuvenated by his involvement with the nation's first pro baseball players. He also finds his senses quickening and tastes changing as he faces life-threatening 19th-century challenges on and off the baseball diamond. Through his attachments to the ballplayers and the lovely Caitlin O'Neill, he might just regain the sense of family he desperately needs.

Equally appealing to sports fans and anyone who likes a good read, If I Never Get Back well deserves the Cleveland Plain Dealer’s judgment that it “hits a home run.”"
751,"As X moves out of the hacker's domain and into the ""real world,"" users can't be expected to master all the ins and outs of setting up and administering their own X software. That will increasingly become the domain of system administrators. Even for experienced system administrators, X raises many issues, both because of subtle changes in the standard UNIX way of doing things and because X blurs the boundaries between different platforms. Under X, users can run applications across the network on systems with different resources (including fonts, colors, and screen size). Many of these issues are poorly understood, and the technology for dealing with them is in rapid flux.This book is the first and only book devoted to the issues of system administration for X and X-based networks, written not just for UNIX system administrators but for anyone faced with the job of administering X (including those running X on stand-alone workstations). The book includes:An overview of X that focuses on issues that affect the system administrator's job.Information on obtaining, compiling, and installing the X software, including a discussion of the trade-offs between vendor-supplied and the free MIT versions of X.How to set up xdm, the X display manager, which takes the place of the login program under X and can be used to create a customized turnkey X session for each user.How to set up user accounts under X (includes a comparison of the familiar shell setup files and programs to the new mechanisms provided by X).Issues involved in making X more secure. X's security features are not strong, but an understanding of what features are available can be very important, since X makes it possible for users to intrude on each other in new and sometimes unexpected ways.How fonts are used by X, including a description of the font server.A discussion of the issues raised by running X on heterogenous networks.How colors are managed under X and how to get the same colors across multiple devices with different hardware characteristics.The administration issues involved in setting up and managing an X terminal.How to use PC and Mac X servers to maximize reuse of existing hardware and convert outdated hardware into X terminals.How to obtain and install additional public domain software and patches for X.Covers features new in R5, including the font server and Xcms."

753,"When zoologist Max Terman came to the rescue of a great horned owlet in a Kansas town park, he embarked on an adventure that would test his scientific ingenuity and lead to unprecedented observations of an owl's hidden life in the wild. In Messages from an Owl, Terman not only relates his experiences nursing the starving owlet, ""Stripey,"" back to health and teaching it survival skills in his barn, but also describes the anxiety and elation of letting a companion loose into an uncertain world. Once Terman felt that Stripey knew how to dive after prey, he set the owl free. At this point his story could have ended, with no clue as to what the young bird's fate would be--had it not been for Terman's experimentation with radio tags. By strapping the tags to Stripey, he actually managed to follow the owl into the wild and observe for himself the behavior of a hand-reared individual reunited with its natural environment.Through this unique use of telemetry, Terman tracked Stripey for over six years after the bird left the scientist's barn and took up residence in the surrounding countryside on the Kansas prairie. The radio beacon provided Terman with information on the owl's regular patterns of playing, hunting, exploring, and protecting. It enabled him to witness the moments when Stripey was bantered and mobbed by crows, when other owls launched fierce attacks, and when a prospective mate caught Stripey's eye. On occasional returns to the barn, the owl would follow Terman around as he performed chores, usually waiting for a handout.Until now, scientists have generally believed that an owl nurtured by humans becomes ill-adapted for meeting the challenges of life in the wild. Terman's research proves otherwise. Stripey surpassed all expectations by becoming a totally independent wild creature. With Terman, however, Stripey remained tame, allowing the author to explore something one rarely sees in owls: a warm interest in humanity. Terman engagingly re-creates this dimension of Stripey as he describes with humor and compassion the daily challenges of probing the life of a ""phantom winged tiger.""Originally published in 1996.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Thorton has imagined Argentina truly; his  inspired fable troubles and feeds our own intriguing imagining.”—Los Angeles TimesImagining Argentina is set in the  dark days of the late 1970's, when thousands of    Argentineans disappeared without a trace into the  general's prison cells and torture   chambers. When  Carlos Ruweda's wife is suddenly taken from him, he  discovers a   magical gift: In waking dreams, he had  clear visions of the fates of “the  disappeared.” But he cannot “imagine” what  has happened to his own wife. Driven to near  madness,   his mind cannot be taken away: imagination, stories, and  the mystical secrets of   the human  spirit.Praise for Imagining Argentina“A harrowing, brilliant  novel.”—The New Yorker“A  powerful new novel . . .

Its central theme is universal.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer“In a time when much North American fiction is contained by crabbed realism, Thorton takes for his material one of the bleaker recent instances of human cruelty, sees in it the enduring nobility of the human spirit and imagines a book that celebrates that spirit.”—The Washington Post Book World “A powerful first  novel and a manifesto for the memorializing power of literature.”—The New York Times Book Review“A  profoundly hopeful book.”—The Cleveland Plain Dealer"

786,"""Carl Anthony takes you inside the world's most famous goldfish bowl for a glimpse at life in the White House as you've never seen it before.""  -- Julie N. Eisenhower  The Kennedy White House is the first truly intimate look at Kennedy family life inside the White House. It is an unprecedented visit behind the scenes, revealing the world's most famous family in the world's most famous house. Author Carl Sferrazza Anthony scoured the Kennedy Library archives for never-before-seen color and black-and-white photographs that succeed in illustrating the Kennedy family story -- the joys and tragedies, celebrations and anniversaries, informal family gatherings and escapes to their private homes in Virginia, Palm Beach, Newport, and Hyannis Port. The book also explores for the first time the relationships between Jack and Jackie's nuclear family and both of their extended families.  The 337 full-color and black-and-white photos, taken by the primary White House photographers, are unstaged and provide a far more natural, spontaneous, and realistic portrait of the family than ever before; most of them, including color photographs of each of the private rooms, have never been seen, and they present an unparalleled look at life as it was lived behind the White House doors.  This is also the first book to place the Kennedy family within the context of the culture of the early 1960s and tell the story of the president's personal maturity through his evolving family relationships. Historical events like the Cuban Missile Crisis are uniquely viewed from the family's perspective. An appealing combination of history, biography, and popular culture, The Kennedy White House sheds new light on a family that continues to fascinate the American public forty years after they first captivated our attention."

From Hindu mythology to Aztec sacrifices, butterflies have served as a metaphor for resurrection and transformation. Even during World War II, children in a Polish death camp scratched hundreds of butterflies onto the walls of their barracks. But as Russell points out in this rich and lyrical meditation, butterflies are above all objects of obsession. From the beastly horned caterpillar, whose blood helps it count time, to the peacock butterfly, with wings that hiss like a snake, Russell traces the butterflies through their life cycles, exploring the creatures' own obsessions with eating, mating, and migrating. In this way, she reveals the logic behind our endless fascination with butterflies as well as the driving passion of such legendary collectors as the tragic Eleanor Glanville, whose children declared her mad because of her compulsive butterfly collecting, and the brilliant Henry Walter Bates, whose collections from the Amazon in 1858 helped develop his theory of mimicry in nature. Russell also takes us inside some of the world's most prestigious natural history museums, where scientists painstakingly catalogue and categorize new species of Lepidoptera, hoping to shed light on insect genetics and evolution. A luminous journey through an exotic world of obsession and strange beauty, this is a book to be treasured by anyone who's ever watched a butterfly mid-flight and thought, as Russell has, ""I've entered another dimension."""
790,"Set in Rio de Janeiro in 1886, this internationally acclaimed literary thriller begins with the theft of a Stradivarius violin that has been presented by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil to one of his more delectable mistresses--a harmless crime in itself but one that mystifies the authorities and (far more important) embarrasses the Emperor.  At the suggestion of Sarah Bernhardt, who is on a triumphant tour through South America, the great Sherlock Holmes is summoned from London to solve the case. But by the time he arrives, events have taken a turn for the worse, as a series of grisly murders shocks the city--the victims all beautiful young women. In each case, the killer leaves his calling card: a violin string entangled in the woman's pubic hair, the corpse stripped of a flap of skin.Holmes (and Dr. Watson, of course) are immediately off on the track of the killer, but although Sherlock succeeds in coining the term ""serial killer,""  his celebrated powers of deduction don't get him very far with the case itself: overcome by the charm of the tropics, some spectacular digestive difficulties, and the strong appeal of a pretty young actress--at thirty-two, he's not exactly a sexual virtuoso--Sherlock finds himself in a thicker fog than he ever encountered back home in London. And in dark counterpoint to Holmes's questionable ratiocinations and the novel's brilliantly re-created texture of nineteenth-century literary, social, and low-life Rio, is the chilling yet hypnotic voice of the killer himself, a monster of intelligence, evil, and ever-spreading fame. . . .A Samba for Sherlock is the work of a mind of encyclopedic knowledge, caustic wit, brilliant style, and, above all, a formidable ability to entertain."
791,"If anything, in this presidential election special, he's madder than ever!In his earlier bestseller, There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos, Hightower only began to tap into the deep yearning that Americans have for a new politics that speaks to them from a real-world, kitchen-table perspective. Now, with the year 2000 being an especially significant marker for contemplating our country's direction, not only for the new year but for the new century and the new millennium, it's time for citizens to reclaim their political, economic, and cultural heritage.Leading the way with his hilariously irreverent yet profoundly serious book is our name-naming, podium-pounding, point-them-in-the-right-direction populist, Hightower himself. He whacks conventional wisdom right upside the head,showing,with startling facts and compelling personal stories, that despite a so-called period of prosperity, America's middle class is getting mugged, and that far from being ordained by the gods,globalization is globaloney! Hightower rips the mass off of the candidates, the parties, the consultants, and especially the moneyed powers whoa re supporting all of the leading presidential hopefuls. he's mad about them all--but what he's maddest about, what really gets his goat,is that they are all the same! To paraphrase Jim, American politicians are alike because they don't come cheap. In fact, they're all very expansive. which is why only the rich can own them and why their allegiance is definitely not to regular,worka-day citizens.No one is spared in this insightful and engaging blend of horror and success stories, hard-hitting commentary, laugh-out-loud humor, useful facts, and sparkling language. An equal opportunity muckraker and conscientious agitator for ""We the people,"" Hightower inspires us to take charge again, to build a new politics, and, together, to build a better tomorrow. Jim Hightower's If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates proves yet again that his is a uniquely wise and peerlessly singular voice in the maelstrom of political prattle."

797,"For Russians, St. Petersburg has embodied power, heroism, and fortitude. It has encompassed all the things that the Russians are and that they hope to become. Opulence and artistic brilliance blended with images of suffering on a monumental scale make up the historic persona of the late W. Bruce Lincoln's lavish ""biography"" of this mysterious, complex city. Climate and comfort were not what Tsar Peter the Great had in mind when, in the spring of 1703, he decided to build a new capital in the muddy marshes of the Neva River delta. Located 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, this area, with its foul weather, bad water, and sodden soil, was so unattractive that only a handful of Finnish fisherman had ever settled there. Bathed in sunlight at midnight in the summer, it brooded in darkness at noon in the winter, and its canals froze solid at least five months out of every year. Yet to the Tsar, the place he named Sankt Pieter Burkh had the makings of a ""paradise."" His vision was soon borne out: though St. Petersburg was closer to London, Paris, and Vienna than to Russia's far-off eastern lands, it quickly became the political, cultural, and economic center of an empire that stretched across more than a dozen time zones and over three continents. In this book, revolutionaries and laborers brush shoulders with tsars, and builders, soldiers, and statesmen share pride of place with poets. For only the entire historical experience of this magnificent and mysterious city can reveal the wealth of human and natural forces that shaped the modern history of it and the nation it represents."
798,"The New York Times bestselling memoir about growing up in small-town Indiana, from the author of The Solace of Leaving Early.

In this witty   and lovingly told memoir, Kimmel takes readers back to a time when small-town America   was caught in the amber of the innocent postwar period&apos;people helped their neighbors,   went to church on Sunday, and kept barnyard animals in their backyards.  Laced with   fine storytelling, sharp wit, dead-on observations, and moments of sheer joy, Haven   Kimmel's straight-shooting portrait of her childhood gives us a heroine who is wonderfully   sweet and sly as she navigates the quirky adult world that surrounds Zippy."

806,"In A People Adrift, a prominent Catholic thinker states bluntly that the Catholic Church in the United States must transform itself or suffer irreversible decline. Peter Steinfels shows how even before the recent revelations about sexual abuse by priests, the explosive combination of generational change and the thinning ranks of priests and nuns was creating a grave crisis of leadership and identity.    This groundbreaking book offers an analysis not just of the church's immediate troubles but of less visible, more powerful forces working below the surface of an institution that provides a spiritual identity for 65 million Americans and spans the nation with its parishes, schools, colleges and universities, hospitals, clinics, and social service agencies.  In A People Adrift, Steinfels warns that entrenched liberals and conservatives are trapped in a ""theo-logical gridlock"" that often ignores what in fact goes on in families, parishes, classrooms, voting booths, and Catholic organizations of all types. Above all, he insists, the altered Catholic landscape demands a new agenda for leadership, from the selection of bishops and the rethinking of the priesthood to the thorough preparation and genuine incorporation of a lay leadership that is already taking over key responsibilities in Catholic institutions.     Catholicism exerts an enormous cultural and political presence in American life. No one interested in the nation's moral, intellectual, and political future can be indifferent to the fate of what has been one of the world's most vigorous churches -- a church now severely challenged."

809,"A hypnotic, lyrical debut novel about a young black girl in the deep south who comes to confront the realities of sex, race, disease, and death, by a writer of extraordinary emotional depth.?A profoundly raw and gripping read,” (The Baltimore Sun) Olympia Vernon’s fearless and wildly original debut novel explodes on the first page and sustains a tightrope intensity until the last. Set in Pyke County, Mississippi, Eden is a raw, heartbreaking, and enlightening novel that marks the emergence of a stunning and original talent. Narrated by fourteen-year-old Maddy Dangerfield, Eden opens in the moments after Maddy has impulsively drawn a naked woman on the pages of Genesis in bright red lipstick during Sunday service. The community is scandalized, and her devout, long-suffering mother’s response to her transgression is to force her to spend weekends nursing her dying Aunt Pip, an outcast who lives on the edge of town.From then on, Maddy must negotiate her two worlds: at the house where she lives with her hard-working, Bible-reading mother, Faye, and her father, Chevrolet?a one-armed drunk, gambler and womanizer?she is both a reluctant participant in and astute observer of the strange and confounding dynamics of her sometimes violent, sometimes tender family. (Years before, Maddy’s grandmother?her mother’s mother?chopped of Chevrolet’s arm and fed it to the pigs after he and Pip were found together in the back room as Faye entertained friends from the church?and ever since, he has been am emasculated, desperate man?drinking and gambling his wife’s money away, leaving her to clean up his mess time and again.) And then out on Commitment Road, she is caretaker to her Aunt Pip, whose only friend is her eccentric neighbor, Fat. Maddy’s time with Pip and Fat opens her eyes to the exhilaration of speaking your own mind, living your life on your own terms and without apology, and also to the cost extracted by both. She learns that there are strengths that belong to women alone, and also that there is a kind of ravaging vulnerability that is terrifying and inescapable, and uniquely female.The world Maddy inherits is one of injustice and hypocrisy, one that requires black people work for the whites for little to no pay; that sent her Uncle Sugar to jail for raping a white woman?no questions asked?when Maddy was just a baby; that preaches Christian love and forgiveness even as its actions reflect the very opposite. But Maddy soon learns that there is something that can work to oppose those truths, and that is knowledge; having the will and the ability to look beneath the surface, to question what others take as a given. By the end of the novel, newly acquainted with mortality and her own fierce strength, Maddy comes to bear both the burden and the blessing of that knowledge.In lush, vivid brushstrokes, Olympia Vernon conjures a world that is both intoxicating and cruel, and illuminates the bittersweet transformation of the young girl who must bear the burden and blessing of its secrets too soon. Eden is a haunting, memorable novel propelled by the poetry and power of a voice that is complex, lyrical, and utterly true."
810,"This brilliantly written, deeply moving play about the problems of a young couple with a spastic daughter-the ""Joe Egg"" of the title-was described by Ronald Bryden in The Observer (London) as a ""remarkable play about a nightmare all women must have dreamed at some time, and most men: living with a child born so hopelessly crippled as to be, as the father in it says brutally, a human parsnip. For all that, it has to be described as a comedy, one of the funniest and most touching I've seen. The bridge between its form and content is a simple but brilliant stroke of theatre. Over the years, the author implies, explaining to others how one lives with such a situation becomes a kind of set party piece. This, savagely exaggerated, is what he has written-a recital, interspersed with jazz, imitations and tap-dances, about life with Joe Egg."""
811,"The Gilded Dome is Greg Kubiak's unique, inside view of a failed attempt to enact campaign finance reform in the U.S. Congress. This saga of Sen. David L. Boren's seven-year struggle to overcome Congressional self-interest and reach a bipartisan consensus demonstrates the power of moneyed interests that gridlocks government and stifles political competition.These efforts at campaign finance reform took shape in 1985, but not until 1987 - when Democrats regained control of the Senate - was Senator Boren's legislation taken seriously. In 1988, following a dramatic fifty-seven-hour session, a record-breaking cloture vote failed, and the money chase continued. Next the Senate and the House pushed to pass separate bills, but that effort failed as the Congress rushed to adjourn. Soon after the 1990 elections, the White House promised to kill the campaign finance reform bill. And just eleven days before a 1992 fundraising dinner at which donors paid $92,000 to be photographed with the president, the legislation was vetoed.In vivid detail The Gilded Dome describes negotiations to produce the most wide-ranging reform of campaign law since Watergate. In addition to describing efforts within Congress, the author explains how others - the media, lobbyists, and party officials - play the game and affect the legislative process. Kubiak concludes that the power of money in politics and the power of people in government must be balanced. Only then will the gilded dome, which conceals the power of money and special interests, reflect the beauty of our democracy."

827,"It is 1837 when Hong ascends to Heaven. While there, he is charged by God, his Heavenly Father - attired in black dragon robe and high-brimmed hat, his mouth almost hidden by his luxuriant golden beard - to slay the demon devils who are leading the people on earth astray. Their leader is Yan Luo, king of hell, the Dragon Demon of the Eastern Sea. Hong does battle in Heaven, armed by his father with sword and seal, aided by his elder brother, Jesus. Returned to his home village in south China, he resolves to carry on the struggle against the evil polluting humanity. He knows himself to be the younger brother of Jesus Christ, God's Chinese son.The Taiping uprising, led by Hong Xiuquan, was a massive millennial movement that, in its violent rise and fall between 1845 and 1864, cost at least twenty million Chinese their lives. In the course of this struggle the Taiping succeeded in overturning the authority of the ruling Qing dynasty throughout a massive territory in southern China. This the Taiping ruled as their Heavenly Kingdom from their seat in Nanjing for eleven years, until they were overcome in an apocalypse wrought by Qing and Western forces, the Book of Revelation become history.In this master work of the historian's art, Jonathan Spence creates a history of intimate detail and grand scale. We enter the fevered dream world of Hong Xiuquan as he meets his Heavenly family; we see the torments awaiting earthly sinners in King Yan Luo's hell; we feel the anxieties of Westerners living circumscribed lives on the edges of a China they do not understand. This is a China of vast instability, ruled by a dynasty in decline, beset by pirates and bandits in areas beyond the government's reach, pressed by Western traders to embrace opium, Western missionaries the word of God, and arms dealers the new weapons of the industrial revolution. Hong's movement ignites this volatile situation, and Spence captures the result on a breathtaking canvas of clashing armies, daring strategic thrusts, and protracted, deadly sieges. It is a story of historical power with striking resonances today."

Unfortunately, there's some truth to that: there are few places in the world where the turncoats and careerists are so highly rewarded and where loyalty is equated with stupidity.  Luckily, another bit of wisdom about the Beltway is also true: the people in Washington aren't like the ones in the rest of the country. The American people treasure loyalty. They stick by a friend when he needs them. They forgive him when he's wrong. They understand the difference between politics and friendship. They are true to their ideals and their schools, loyal to their families and their God.  In Stickin', the always colorful and insightful political strategist James Carville, who has been accused of being loyal, examines this much-maligned and misunderstood political good. Along the way, he looks at loyalty in the family and among friends, in theory and in practice. He praises some loyal people and skewers some deserving backstabbers. And, of course, it wouldn't be a Carville book if he didn't provide recipes for some good home cooking."

Thomas learned that Linda was reading at the festival and chose this moment to reestablish contact with a woman he passionately pursued years earlier. Their affair was disastrous, and a turning point in both their lives. Neither the intensity of their relationship nor the damage it did has ever been far from his memory.From the moment they speak, The Last Time They Met unfolds the story of Linda and Thomas in an extraordinary way: it travels back into their past, bypassing layers of memory and interpretation to present their earlier encounters with unshakable immediacy.

871,"America is browning. As politicians, schoolteachers, and grandparents attempt to decipher what that might mean, Richard Rodriguez argues America has been brown from its inception, as he himself is.  As a brown man, I think . . .  (But do we really think that color colors thought?)  In his two previous memoirs, Hunger of Memory and Days of Obligation, Rodriguez wrote about the intersection of his private life with public issues of class and ethnicity. With Brown, his consideration of race, Rodriguez completes his ""trilogy on American public life.""  For Rodriguez, brown is not a singular color. Brown is evidence of mixture. Brown is a shade created by desire-an emblem of the erotic history of America, which began the moment the African and the European met within the Indian eye. Rodriguez reflects on various cultural associations of the color brown-toil, decay, impurity, time-arranging dazzling juxtapositions for which he is justly famous: Alexis de Tocqueville, Malcolm X, minstrel shows, Broadway musicals, Puritanism, the Sistine Chapel, Cubism, homosexuality, and the influence on his life of two federal figures-Ben Franklin and Richard Nixon (""the dark father of Hispanicity"").  At the core of the book is an assessment of the meaning of Hispanics to the life of America. Reflecting upon the new demographic profile of our country, Rodriguez observes that Hispanics are becoming Americanized at the same rate that the United States is becoming Latinized. Hispanics are coloring an American identity that traditionally has chosen to describe itself as black and white."

882,"The acclaimed author of Fire in the Belly presents an exhilarating memoir of his late-blooming love affair with the flying trapeze--and a provocative look at the potential it offers for growth and transformation.Since he first experienced the joy and freedom of flight while swinging from trees as a boy in Alabama and Tennessee, Sam Keen dreamed of being able to fly. But it was only when, at age sixty-one, he happened upon a trapeze training program at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts that he took up the quest in earnest. After ascending to the platform thirty-one feet in the air and grasping the trapeze bar, Keen dove into the ocean of emptiness above the net, lost in the pleasure of swinging. Returning to the trapeze again and again, he gradually developed the poise and confidence that allowed him to release himself from the bar and soar--airborne--into the hands of a catcher. Having tasted the elation of actual flight, Keen's childhood dream became a passion and a vehicle for exploring the challenges and dilemmas of life.In Learning to Fly, Keen traces the life journey that led him to respond to the lure of the trapeze late in his life and shares what his five years of intensive practice have taught him about living more intensely and passionately. He also recounts how his recognition of this art form's transcendent powers led him to launch Upward Bound, a trapeze workshop for anyone facing deeply rooted fears.An unprecedented adventure of the soul and psyche, Learning to Fly teaches us to soar on the wings of possibility as we watch Keen and his students progress through breathtaking exercises. As he describes take-offs and knee hangs and thrilling mid-air catches, Keen imparts moving revelations about risk-taking, trust, bravado, true strength, falling, and letting go.

As the last American official to meet with Saddam before Desert Storm, Wilson successfully parried the dictator's threats to use American hostages as human shields against U.S. bombing.

When President Bush alleged that Iraq had pursued uranium from Africa for its nuclear weapons program, Wilson could not stand silent.

914,"Highly acclaimed as translators of Greek and Sanskrit classics, respectively, David Grene and Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty here present a complete modern translation of the three plays comprising Aeschylus' Orestia and, with the assistance of director Nicholas Rudall, an abridged stage adaptation. This blanced and highly successful collaboration of scholars with a theater director solves the contemporary problems of translating and staging the Orestia, which originally was written to be performed in Athens in the first half of the fifth century B.C. While remaning faithful to the original Greek, Grene and O'Flaherty embrace a strong and adventurous English style, vivid and visceral. The language of this extraordinary translation, immediately accessible to a theater audience, speaks across the centuries. Premiered at Chicago's Court Theater in 1986 under Rudall's direction, the stage adaptation of the Orestia proved eminently playable.  This new adaptation of the orestia offers a brilliant demonstration of how clearly defined goals (here, the actor's needs) can inspire translators to produce fresh, genuine, accessible dramatic texts. The resulting work provides complete and accurate texts for those who cannot read the original Greek, and it transforms the Orestia into an effective modern stage play. With interpretive introductions written by the translators and director, this new version will be welcomed by teachers of translation courses, by students of Greek and world drama in general, and by theater professionals."

944,"Ancient medical science told us our minds and bodies are one. So did philosophers of old. Now, modern science and new research are helping us to understand these connections. In Healing and the Mind, Bill Moyers talks with physicians, scientists, therapists, and patients - people who are taking a new look at the meaning of sickness and health. In a series of fascinating and provocative interviews, he discusses their search for answers to perplexing questions: How do emotions translate into chemicals in our bodies? How do thoughts and feelings influence health? How can we collaborate with our bodies to encourage healing?Healing and the Mind travels from small private clinics to large public hospitals to examine how advances in mind/body medicine are being applied on a day-to-day level in the hurried and technology-driven world of modern medicine. From neonatal care to geriatrics, from day surgery to the treatment of chronic illness, medical professionals are finding that when they practice the ""new medicine,"" their patients heal faster, leave the hospital sooner, and do better once they get home.Bill Moyers and David Grubin also travel to the People's Republic of China. There they explore the implications of that country's fusion of Western practices with traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, massage, herbal potions, and the mysterious concept called chi. They take an intimate look at alternate therapy programs, including a Massachusetts medical center that combines Eastern meditation with Western therapy in the treatment of ailments as diverse as hypertension and chronic back pain. And they visit a California retreat where cancer patients help each other discover that healing can occur even when a cure is impossible.With the incisive style that has made Bill Moyers's skills as an interviewer legendary, and the dynamic interplay of text and art that has made his previous books international bestsellers, Healing and the Mind is a landmark work, destined to influence how America thinks about sickness and health."

954,"Long before the Endangered Species Act and the spotted owl controversy, American conservationists debated the ethics of wildlife protection.  Although all were alarmed by the rapid destruction of game species in the late 1800s, some sought to preserve animals for their aesthetic and material benefit to humans, while others believed it was wrong to mistreat any wild creature.  Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics shows how the latter view evolved into the animal rights activism of today.  Lisa Mighetto examines portrayals of wildlife in popular literature dating from the nineteenth century, revealing how early conservationists looked for evidence of morality in animals that would make them more acceptable to the American public.  Arguing that animals should be protected because they think, feel, and act in a manner similar to humans, some went so far as to claim that these creatures have rights.    Not all wild animals readily conformed to the new image.  The first conservationists did not extend their ethics to predators or ""varmints,"" and supported government efforts to wipe them out.  By describing how animal lovers gradually came to advocate protection of even these creatures, Mighetto traces the development of modern ecological values and the biocentric perspective.  Americans now stand at a critical point in wildlife protection, wielding the threat of extinction over numerous species.  Mighetto places arguments regarding wildlife protection in historical perspective and thus helps us evaluate our inherited attitudes and assumptions about the animal world.  Enhancing the text are more than fifty illustrations that demonstrate the interaction between humans and wildlife over the last century."

956,"The Color of Truth is the definitive biography of McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy, two of ""the best and the brightest"" who advised presidents about peace and war during the most dangerous years of the Cold War. The Bundy brothers embodied all the idealism and hubris that animated American foreign policy in the decades after World War II. They will be remembered forever as anti-communist liberals who, despite their grave doubts about sending Americans to fight in Southeast Asia, became key architects of America's war in Vietnam.  Kai Bird, the author of The Chairman, the acclaimed biography of John J. McCloy, brilliantly recreates the world of Boston Brahmin privilege in which the Bundy brothers were reared to govern. Educated at Groton, Yale and Harvard, Mac and Bill Bundy were protégés of Henry Stimson, Dean Acheson and Justice Felix Frankfurter, and their friends and admirers included Walter Lippmann, Joseph Alsop and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Bill played a major role in the supersecret ULTRA code-breaking project that proved invaluable to the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany. Mac, a key military aide, was present at D-day and later wrote Stimson's influential but misleading essay explaining Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb.  In the 1950s, both brothers became ensnared in Senator Joseph McCarthy's witchhunts against suspected communists in government and academia. As dean of Harvard College, Mac fought to protect his tenured faculty while sacrificing junior scholars who refused to ""name names"" to the FBI. Bill, a high-ranking CIA official, saw his career nearly destroyed when McCarthy learned he had contributed money to Alger Hiss's defense fund. Bill's refusal to testify before the senator's committee was a turning point in the battle against McCarthyism.  The brothers reached the apex of the national security establishment under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Kennedy appointed Mac Bundy to be his national security adviser, and Bill Bundy moved into senior positions at the Pentagon and the State Department. One or the other was involved in many of the triumphs and deceits of the Kennedy years, including the Bay of Pigs fiasco, plots to eliminate Fidel Castro and the Cuban Missile Crisis. But it was their role in guiding the nation to war in Vietnam that engulfed them in controversy and indelibly marked them as failed figures in American history.  At every stage of the war -- from the assassination of South Vietnamese president Diem in 1963 to the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, from the bombing campaign of Operation Rolling Thunder to President Johnson's July 1965 decision to send hundreds of thousands of U.S. combat troops to Vietnam -- the Bundy brothers were present, urging a policy of gradual escalation. Long after Johnson had dismissed their warning that Vietnam could become a ""white man's war"" on the Asian mainland, the Bundys remained loyal to their liberal president, who was determined not to allow right-wing critics to accuse him of losing another Asian country to communism. Even after Mac left the government in 1966 to become the controversial president of the Ford Foundation, he remained silent on the war. Bill stayed on in Washington until 1969, prosecuting a war he knew was unwinnable.  Based on nearly a hundred interviews with the Bundy brothers, their families and colleagues, and on thousands of pages of archival documents -- including some White House memos that remain classified -- Bird's account contains dramatic new information that alters the history of the Vietnam War. Like the bestselling The Wise Men, this dual biography is both an inside account of the making of U.S. foreign policy in an era of nuclear weapons and a stunning group portrait of the heirs of the Wise Men -- including Robert McNamara, George Ball and Robert Kennedy -- and the presidents they served.

959,"Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. sat for thirty-four years on the United States Supreme Court. Throughout his tenure on the Court he meticulously examined the body of Constitutional law - and effectively resuscitated its spirit. A champion of minorities and a spokesman for the politically dispossessed, he passionately defended civil rights and strove to bring the nation's disenfranchised into the mainstream of American life. He advanced the political empowerment of American cities and suburbs. He essentially wrote the modern law of freedom of speech and the press.Justice Brennan's retirement in 1990 occasioned tributes from a host of associates, former law clerks, attorneys, judges, professors, journalists, and friends. The reflections on Brennan in Part I of this volume provide intimate, often humorous glimpses into a generous, warm, open-hearted man who also happened to be an intellectual giant and outstanding jurist.In Part II the jurisprudence of Justice Brennan is comprehensively surveyed and lucidly discussed by author and Constitutional law professor Roger Goldman. With care he examines - and in layman's terms explains - Brennan's positions on the issues central to the justice's career: the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, civil rights, education, abortion, obscenity, and capital punishment.Eloquent, persuasive, and faithful to his vision, Justice Brennan authored more than a thousand opinions, concurrences, and dissents in the course of his judicial career. Part III of the book offers twelve landmark decisions written by Brennan that show clearly why history will place him beside John Marshall, Louis Brandeis, and Oliver Wendell Holmes as one of the truly great justices in the annals of the United States Supreme Court."

963,"Given unprecedented access to Pope John Paul II and the people who have known and worked with him throughout his life, George Weigel presents a groundbreaking portrait of the Pope as a man, a thinker, and a leader whose religious convictions have defined a new approach to world politics -- and changed the course of history.  John Paul II has systematically addressed every major question on the world's agenda at the turn of the millennium: the human yearning for the sacred, the meaning of freedom, the glories and challenges of human sexuality, the promise of the women's movement, the quest for a new world order, the nature of good and evil, the moral challenge of prosperity, and the imperative of human solidarity in the emerging global civilization.By bringing the age-old wisdom of biblical religion into active conversation with contemporary life and thought, the Pope ""from a far country"" has crafted a challenging proposal for the human future that is without parallel in the modern world.  Weigel explores new information about the Pope's role in some of the recent past's most stirring events, including the fall of communism; the Vatican/Israel negotiation of 1991-92; the collapse of the Philippine, Chilean, Nicaraguan, and Paraguayan dictatorships during the 1980s; and the epic papal visit to Cuba. Weigel also includes previously unpublished papal correspondence with Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Deng Xiaoping, and draws on hitherto unavailable autobiographical reminiscences by the Pope.  Witness to Hope also discusses the Pope's efforts to build bridges to other Christian communities, and to Judaism, Islam, and other great world religions; presents an analysis of John Paul's proposals for strengthening democratic societies in the twenty-first century; and offers synopses of every major teaching document in the pontificate.  Rounding out the dramatic story of Pope John Paul II are fresh translations of his poetry; detailed personal anecdotes of the Pope as a young man, priest, and friend, sketched by those who knew him best; and in-depth interviews with Catholic leaders throughout the world.  A magisterial biography of one of the most important figures -- some might argue, the most important figure -- of the twentieth century, Witness to Hope is an extraordinary testimony to the man and his accomplishments, and a papal biography unlike any other."
964,"No one in history had a more eventful career in matrimony than Henry VIII. His marriages were daring and tumultuous, and made instant legends of six very different women. In this remarkable study, David Starkey argues that the king was not a depraved philanderer but someone seeking happiness -- and a son. Knowingly or not, he elevateda group of women to extraordinary heights and changed the way a nation was governed.Six Wives is a masterful work of history that intimately examines the rituals of diplomacy, marriage, pregnancy, and religion that were part of daily life for women at the Tudor Court. Weaving new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama surrounding Henry's six marriages, David Starkey reveals the central role that the queens played in determining policy.

972,"In 1983, Michael S. Dell, then an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, drove away from his parents' Houston home in a white BMW  he'd bought selling subscriptions to his hometown newspaper. In the backseat were three personal computers.  Today, he is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Computer Corporation, an $18 billion company, the second-largest manufacturer and marketer of computers in the world. Founded on a deceptively simple premise--to deliver high-performance computer systems directly to the end user--Dell Computer is the envy of its competition, constantly growing at five  times the industry rate, and a perennial darling of Wall Street: its stock is up more than 36,000 percent this decade, and more than 200 percent in the last year.  In  Direct From Dell, Michael Dell himself tells the incredible story of Dell Computer's successful rise, beginning in his college dorm room with $1,000 in capital.  In these pages, you'll see the formation of a great visionary--and a great company. You'll meet the young Dell who, at the tender age of eight, had already begun looking ""to eliminate unnecessary steps"" and who, as a numbers-loving adolescent, was inspired by a newfound fascination with computers to save his money to buy a coveted Apple II--only to promptly take it apart. You'll encounter a young visionary who, upon witnessing  the inefficiencies of an exploding industry, challenged conventional wisdom and set out to do nothing less than  beat IBM at its own game. In so doing, Dell forever changed the way things ""had always been done"" in the computer industry.  You'll also see the birth of a Dell  hallmark--the direct model--which, in its ability to reach the customer directly, eliminated not only a substantial middleman markup but also the possibility of costly excess inventory, setting the stage for other extraordinary achievements. In an industry notorious for its unreliable service, Dell utilized its direct customer relationships to pioneer the concept of customer ""support""--and didn't rest until the caliber of its service was rivaled only by the quality of its products and its speed of delivery.  But the story of Dell Computer is no fairy tale. Marked by uncharacteristically rapid growth, the company was faced with challenges that could have threatened its very existence. From forays into retail to under- (and over-) developed product lines, Dell learned some hard lessons along the way--and emerged stronger as a result.  The strategies born of those times--unrivaled speed to market; superior customer service; a fierce commitment to producing  constantly high-quality custom-made systems--heralded what has perhaps been the company's crowning achievement: an early exploitation of the Internet. One of the first companies to actually make money online, Dell is now selling more than $12 million worth of systems per day over www.dell.com.  Not just for CEOs or those in high tech, the strategies revealed in Direct From Dell are invaluable to managers in a broad cross section of industries. From starting a successful business to pioneering computer sales and service over the Internet, Dell shares his perspectives on:  Why it's infinitely better for any business starting out to have too little capital, rather than too much  How studying your customers--not your competition--will give you a greater competitive edge  Why it can be life-threatening to your company to pursue too many good ideas--or to grow too fast  Why it's essential to run a P&L on every area of your business  Why your people prose a greater threat to the health of your business than your competition does  How you can exploit your competition's weakness by exposing its greatest strength  How integrating your business virtually can make the difference between being quick--and being dead  Revealing nothing less than a new model for doing business in the information age, Direct From Dell is both an extraordinary business success story and a manifesto for revolutionizing any industry."

977,"One of the engineering wonders of the world, the Inca Road was built more than five hundred years ago to link the far-flung outposts of a fabled empire -- an empire that ruled in golden splendor until the conquistadors arrived to plunder El Dorado and put a swift, cruel end to its extraordinary culture. But its legend survives in the masterful masonry of its paving blocks and the ruined glory of ghost cities such as Cuzco. In this vivid, free-wheeling expedition, Karin Muller travels the ancient route to explore its dramatic history and discover new adventures along its length and breadth.  Along the Inca Road shares the stillness of sunrise in the haunted aerie of Machu Picchu, clings to the roof of a rattletrap bus skirting the vertiginous precipices of the Andes, carouses through the streets of an Altiplano city on Carnival, and inches warily forward as Ecuadorian soldiers probe for land mines with bayonets. Muller's ready for just about anything, whether it's challenging the Pacific surf in a traditional Inca reed boat, locking horns with a bull in a cheering Peruvian arena, or joining a crack Bolivian anti-narcotics team on a hunt for clandestine cocaine labs deep in the jungle. She initiates us into the mysteries of the spirits at a shaman's rite involving hamsters, hallucinogens, and copious libations of moonshine, and high in a mountain meadow captures a struggling vicuna, whose prized silky fleece once was reserved for the Inca god-king alone. And these are only a few of the traveler's tales from a 3,125-mile odyssey encompassing four countries and every form of transportation under the sun, from footslogging, mule train, and motorbike to state-of-the-art military vehicles.  As she spins the wool of her stories into a modern tapestry of faces and memories, Muller intertwines a chronicle of the ancient Inca from their race's mythical birth on an island in lofty Lake Titicaca to their sudden plunge from the height of imperial power at the hands of a ragtag band of Spanish soldiers of fortune. We learn how they lived, worshipped, and warred, and why such a magnificent culture proved so vulnerable to invaders.  As spectacular as the mountainscapes that are its breathtaking backdrop, Along the Inca Road is a wonderful panorama of past and present -- the kind of sharply observed portrait of a unique part of the world and its colorful people that displays the art of travel literature at its best."

1020,"James Bradley's #1 bestseller Flags of Our Fathers made real the humanity and legacy of war as few books had before. Now, in Flyboys, Bradley returns to World War II and an extraordinary-and totally unknown-true story of courage.Over the remote Pacific island of Chichi Jima, nine American flyers-Navy and Marine pilots sent to bomb Japanese communications towers there-were shot down. One of those nine was miraculously rescued by a U.S. Navy submarine. The others were captured by Japanese soldiers on Chichi Jima and held prisoner.Then they disappeared.When the war was over, the American government, along with the Japanese, covered up everything that had happened on Chichi Jima. The records of a top-secret military tribunal were sealed, the lives of the eight Flyboys were erased, and the parents, brothers, sisters, and sweethearts they left behind were left to wonder.Flyboys reveals for the first time ever the extraordinary story of those men. Bradley's quest for the truth took him from dusty attics in American small towns, to untapped government archives containing classified documents, to the heart of Japan, and finally to Chichi Jima itself. What he discovered was a mystery that dated back far before World War II-back 150 years, to America's westward expansion and Japan's first confrontation with the western world.Bradley brings into vivid focus these brave young men who went to war for their country, and through their lives he also tells the larger story of two nations in a hellish war. With no easy moralizing, Bradley presents history in all its savage complexity, including the Japanese warrior mentality that fostered inhuman brutality and the U.S. military strategy that justified attacks on millions of civilians. And, after almost sixty years of mystery, Bradley finally reveals the fate of the eight American Flyboys, all of whom would ultimately face a moment and a decision that few of us can even imagine.Flyboys is a story of war and horror but also of friendship and honor. It is about how we die, and how we live-including the tale of the Flyboy who escaped capture, a young Navy pilot named George H. W. Bush who would one day become president of the United States. A masterpiece of historical narrative, Flyboys will change forever our understanding of the Pacific war and the very things we fight for."

So are the best wiretaps FBI money can buy. * Skinny Al weighed 320 pounds and lived life to the fullest...until someone burned out his eardrums and shot his body full of holes. Hundreds of writers have tried to capture life inside the mob, but no one has ever had the inside access to write a book like this one.

At Columbia University, a professor of Russian literature has gone missing.

She knows the missing man is important-and somehow connected to a recent mob hit. While Eddie and Bobby are fighting their way through ugly deeds and pretty coeds, these feds will cook up some business of their own, turning a little disagreement among criminals into an all-out war...

1058,"The captivating, inside story of the woman who helmed the Washington Post during one of the most turbulent periods in the history of American media.Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for BiographyIn this bestselling and widely acclaimed memoir, Katharine Graham, the woman who piloted the Washington Post through the scandals of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, tells her story—one that is extraordinary both for the events it encompasses and for the courage, candor, and dignity of its telling.    Here is the awkward child who grew up amid material wealth and emotional isolation; the young bride who watched her brilliant, charismatic husband—a confidant to John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson—plunge into the mental illness that would culminate in his suicide. And here is the widow who shook off her grief and insecurity to take on a president and a pressman’s union as she entered the profane boys’ club of the newspaper business.   As timely now as ever, Personal History is an exemplary record of our history and of the woman who played such a shaping role within them, discovering her own strength and sense of self as she confronted—and mastered—the personal and professional crises of her fascinating life."
1059,"WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR DRAMARecently revived on Broadway in a production directed by Joe Mantello, starring two-time Oscar winner Glenda Jackson and Tony winner Laurie MetcalfEarning a Pulitzer and Best Play awards from the Evening Standard, Critics Circle, and Outer Critics Circle, among others, when it premiered, Edward Albee has, in Three Tall Women, created a masterwork of modern theater.  As an imperious, acerbic old woman lies dying, she is tended by two other women and visited by a young man.  Albee’s frank dialogue about everything from incontinence to infidelity portrays aging without sentimentality.  His scenes are charged with wit, pain, and laughter, and his observations tell us about forgiveness, reconciliation, and our own fates.  But it is his probing portrait of the three women that reveals Albee’s genius.  Separate characters on stage in the first act, yet actually the same “everywoman” at different ages in the second act, these “tall women” lay bare the truths of our lives—how we live, how we love, what we settle for, and how we die.  Edward Albee has given theatergoers, critics, and students of drama reason to rejoice."

1072,"The extraordinary breakthrough management program--heralded by GE, Motorola, and AlliedSignal--that is sweeping corporate America with its unprecedented ability to achieve superior financial results.Six Sigma is the most powerful breakthrough management tool ever devised, promising increased market share, cost reductions, and dramatic improvements in bottom-line profitability for companies of any size. The darling of Wall Street, it has become the mantra of Fortune 500 boardrooms around the world because it works.What is Six Sigma? It is first and foremost a business process that enables companies to increase profits dramatically by streamlining operations, improving quality, and eliminating defects or mistakes in everything a company does, from filling out purchase orders to manufacturing airplane engines. While traditional quality programs have focused on detecting and correcting defects, Six Sigma encompasses something broader: It provides specific methods to re-create the process itself so that defects are never produced in the first place.Most companies operate at a three- to four-sigma level, where the cost of defects is roughly 20 to 30 percent of revenues. By approaching Six Sigma--fewer than one defect per 3.4 million opportunities--the cost of quality drops to less than 1 percent of sales.This is because the highest quality also results in the lowest costs. When GE reduced its costs from 20 percent to less than 10 percent, it saved a billion dollars in just two years--money that goes directly to the bottom line. This is the reason Wall Street and corporations as diverse as Sony, Ford, Nokia, Texas Instruments, Canon, Hitachi, Lockheed Martin, American Express, Toshiba, DuPont, and Polaroid have embarked on corporate-wide Six Sigma programs.Six Sigma should be of paramount importance to every forward-thinking executive and manager determined to make their company world-class in their industry."
1073,"It was the greatest invasion the world had ever seen. Officially known as ""Operation Overlord,"" this World War II assault began on the morning of June 6, 1944. Thousands of American, British, and Canadian soldiers aboard hundreds of landing craft attacked beaches along nearly fifty miles of France's coastline in Normandy. Backing them up were the big guns of some of the mightiest ships in the Allied navies, and countless bomber, fighter, and transport aircraft. By the end of that day, an Allied army had made it ashore despite sometimes fierce opposition, signaling the end of Nazi tyranny over Europe. Using the real-life stories of young men caught up in this great event, along with original paintings, photographs, and memorabilia, D-Day, the book, will present a compelling account of this world-changing day. Shelly Tanaka is the author of many acclaimed books of nonfiction for children, including the first two books in The Day That Changed America Series: Gettysburg and The Alamo. She is also the author of Attack on Pearl Harbor and many of the books in the ""I Was There"" series."
1074,"In 1789, when the First Congress met in New York City, the members traveled to the capital just as Roman senators two thousand years earlier had journeyed to Rome, by horse, at a pace of some five miles an hour. Indeed, if sea travel had improved dramatically since Caesar's time, overland travel was still so slow, painful, and expensive that most Americans lived all but rooted to the spot, with few people settling more than a hundred miles from the ocean (a mere two percent lived west of the Appalachians). America in effect was just a thin ribbon of land by the sea, and it wasn't until the coming of the steam railroad that our nation would unfurl across the vast inland territory.     In Railroads Triumphant, Albro Martin provides a fascinating history of rail transportation in America, moving well beyond the ""Romance of the Rails"" sort of narrative to give readers a real sense of the railroad's importance to our country. The railroad, Martin argues, was ""the most fundamental innovation in American material life."" It could go wherever rails could be laid--and so, for the first time, farms, industries, and towns could leave natural waterways behind and locate anywhere. (As Martin points out, the railroads created small-town America just as surely as the automobile created the suburbs.) The railroad was our first major industry, and it made possible or promoted the growth of all other industries, among them coal, steel, flour milling, and commercial farming. It established such major cities as Chicago, and had a lasting impact on urban design. And it worked hand in hand with the telegraph industry to transform communication. Indeed, the railroads were the NASA of the 19th century, attracting the finest minds in finance, engineering, and law.     But Martin doesn't merely catalogue the past greatness of the railroad. In closing with the episodes that led first to destructive government regulation, and then to deregulation of the railroads and the ensuing triumphant rebirth of the nation's basic means of moving goods from one place to another, Railroads Triumphant offers an impassioned defense of their enduring importance to American economic life. And it is a book informed by a lifelong love of railroads, brimming with vivid descriptions of classic depots, lavish hotels in Chicago, the great railroad founders, and the famous lines. Thoughtful and colorful by turn, this insightful history illuminates the impact of the railroad on our lives."

1088,"Peter Arnett is undeniably the dean of his generation's war correspondents, a breed apart. Daring, wily, willing to put himself at enormous risk for a story. Arnett is a thinking man and a man of action.From his youth in New Zealand in the 1940s, Arnett knew journalism would be his ticket to the world. And it was - to Bangkok; then to Laos, where Arnett swam across the Mekong River to file his dispatches from Thailand; and then on to Indonesia, where he traveled with Sukarno until he was expelled after only thirteen months for his reporting on the developing war.In 1962, Arnett was sent to Vietnam along with David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan, Mal Browne, Stanley Karnow and the rest of a new young group of foreign correspondents that would later include Dan Rather, Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings. When American ground forces were committed, Arnett went right in with them. His controversial coverage for the Associated Press incurred the wrath of President Johnson but won him a Pulitzer Prize. After the fall of Saigon, when many of his peers had gone, Arnett stayed behind to get the whole story.With the dedication, passion and intelligence that one finds in great foreign correspondents, Arnett has pursued the whole story ever since. After covering wars in Cyprus and Lebanon, he joined CNN in 1981. News was going live, twenty-four hours a day, and Arnett was going with it - from San Salvador to Moscow to Iraq.

1100,"Now available in paperback, the New York Times bestseller. When John F. Kennedy called America ""the land we love"" more than 42 years ago, he was reminding us of the lofty ideals on which our country was founded. But what are those ideals, and how have Americans defined them Is America the land of George Washington and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who rallied the country's spirits for unity in wartime, or is it a land of dissent, a land in which Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Martin Luther King, Jr. remind us of our duty to protect our most fundamental freedoms? Are we defined by the speeches of Thomas Jefferson and Ronald Reagan or by the humor of H.L. Mencken and Mark Twain? Caroline Kennedy's answer in A Patriot's Handbook is that we are all of those things and more. The poems, songs, speeches, letters, and historical documents that Caroline Kennedy has chosen for this remarkable collection remind us of the foundations on which America was built. But they also ask us to examine what it truly means to be a ""patriot,"" even if our assumptions are challenged along the way, because it is only by doing so that America can ""truly be our own."" Voices as diverse as the nation itself:  Thomas Jefferson Cole Porter Chief Red Jacket Amy Tan Betty Friedan Albert Einstein George W. Bush Loretta Lynn John F.

1101,"""I'm still here, still arriving at the White House in the wee hours of the morning, reading the papers and checking the wire, still waiting for the morning briefing, still sitting down to write the first story of the day and still waiting to ask the tough questions.""  From the woman who has reported on every president from Kennedy to Clinton for United Press International: a unique glimpse into the White House -- and a telling record of the ever-changing relationship between the presidency and the press.  From her earliest years, Helen Thomas wanted to be a reporter. Raised in Depression-era Detroit, she worked her way to Washington after college and, unlike other women reporters who gave up their jobs to returning veterans, parlayed her copy-aide job at the Washington Daily News into a twelve-year stint as a radio news writer for UPI, covering such beats as the Department of Justice and other federal agencies.  Assigned to the White House press corps in 1961, Thomas was the first woman to close a press conference with ""Thank you, Mr. President,"" and has covered every administration since Kennedy's. Along the way, she was among the pioneers who broke down barriers against women in the national media, becoming the first female president of the White House Correspondents Association, the first female officer of the National Press Club and the first woman member, later president, of the Gridiron Club.  In this revealing memoir, which includes hundreds of anecdotes, insights, observations, and personal details, Thomas looks back at a career spent with presidents at home and abroad, on the ground and in the air. She evaluates the enormous changes that Watergate brought, including diminished press access to the Oval Office, and how they have affected every president since Nixon. Providing a unique view of the past four decades of presidential history, Front Row at the White House offers a seasoned study of the relationship between the chief executive officer and the press -- a relationship that is sometimes uneasy, sometimes playful, yet always integral to democracy.  ""Soon enough there will be another president, another first lady, another press secretary and a whole new administration to discover. I'm looking forward to it -- although I'm sure whoever ends up in the Oval Office in a new century may not be so thrilled about the prospect."""

1109,"‘I cried because I did not have an office with a door, until I met a man who had no cubicle.’ DilbertA message from Scott Adams:I think the next wave of office design will focus on eliminating the only remaining obstacle to office productivity: your happiness. Happiness isn’t a physical thing, like walls and doors. But it’s closely related. Managers know that if they can eliminate all traces of happiness, the employees won’t be so picky about their physical surroundings. Once you’re hopelessly unhappy, you won’t bother to complain if your boss rolls you up in a tight ball and crams you into a cardboard box.As soon as I noticed this disturbing threat to workplace happiness, I did some investigative work and discovered it wasn’t confined to the issue of office design. Companies were making a direct frontal assault on employee happiness in every possible way! I knew there was only one thing that could stop the horror.It was time for another Dilbert book. It might sound corny, but I felt an obligation to society. People told me it was time for me to ‘give something back to the community.’ This scared me, until I realised that no one knows I furnished my house with street signs and park benches. So I interpreted the ‘give something back to the community’ message as a plea for me to write this book and then charge the community to read it.In the first part of this book I will tell you how to find happiness at the expense of your co-workers, managers, customers, and – best of all – those lazy stockholders. The second part of the book teaches you my top-secret methods for mining humour out of ordinary situations, thus making it easier to mock the people around you.

You can produce sounds in the office that will drive your co-workers insane. That can be very entertaining. Every co-worker is different, so you might have to experiment to find the sounds that are most annoying to your cubicle neighbour. It’s worth the effort."

1166,"An irreverent, hard-hitting examination of the world's largest-and most reviled-corporation, which reveals that while Wal-Mart's dominance may be providing consumers with cheap goods and plentiful jobs, it may also be breeding a culture of discontent.   It employs one of every 115 American workers. If it were a nation-state, it would be one of the world's top twenty economies. With yearly sales of nearly $260 billion and an average way of $8 an hour, Wal-Mart represents an unprecedented-and perhaps unstoppable-force in capitalism. And there have been few corporations that have evoked the same levels of reverence and ire.   The United States of Wal-Mart is a hard-hitting examination of how Sam Walton's empire has infiltrated not just the geography of America but also its consciousness. Peeling away layers of propaganda and politics, investigative journalist John Dicker reveals an American (and, increasingly, a global) story that has no clear-cut villains or heroes-one that could be the confused, complicated story of America itself.   Pitched battles between economic progress and quality of life, between the preservation of regional identity and national homogeneity, and between low prices and the dignity of the American worker are beginning to coalesce into an all-out war to define our modern era. And, Dicker argues, Wal-Mart is winning. Revealing that the company's business practices have been shaping American culture, including the nation's social, political, and industrial policy, The United States of Wal-Mart provides fresh insight into a controversy that isn't going away."

1208,"In September 1787 the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new Federal Constitution to replace the beleaguered Articles of Confederation. Each state then had to call a convention of its own to vote on ratification. Pennsylvania, like many states, was deeply divided over the new constitution. For six months Federalists and Antifederalists fought a bitter and, on occasion, violent political battle, with the Federalists ultimately prevailing.In this detailed study of Pennsylvania, the first in fifty years, Owen S. Ireland argues that the overwhelming majority of voters in Pennsylvania favored ratification. While many modern views of the ratification conflict in America explain the Federalist success as a victory of the ""patrician"" minority over the ""plebeian"" majority, Ireland finds that political divisions were based less on class, sectional, and occupational differences than on partisan attachments rooted in religious and ethnic conflicts. The state Constitutionalist party, dominated by Presbyterians, opposed ratification, while the Anglican-led Republicans supported it. Voters from Scots-Irish and German Reformed backgrounds joined the Antifederalists, and those from virtually every other ethnic and religious group supported the Federalists.Ireland has long concentrated his scholarly work on assembling and analyzing quantitative data on politics and politicians in late eighteenth-century Pennsylvania. Here he uses the results of this research as the foundation on which to build a narrative of one of the most dramatic and significant events of the Revolutionary era."

1217,"Work and art are not, as we have come to believe, mutually exclusive. The industrial revolution, it can be said, drove art out of work. Our new-found ability for mass production robbed workers of their art, forcing them to find ""jobs."" Work quickly came to be viewed as something we do to survive and art merely something to hang on our walls. The reward for work became extrinsic rather than intrinsic. Instead of pursuing joy within work, we began to pursue it in leisure and in the external rewards of employment. In Artful Work, Dick Richards reminds us that all work can be artful, and that artfulness is the key to passion and commitment. He applies the assumptions of artists about work and life to the challenges facing people and organizations in today&apos;s rapidly changing world. This book provides a new perspective on those challenges that is both practical and visionary, singing a provocative new tune for those journeying to make work more meaningful and joyful, and organizations more committed to their purposes. Readers will learn to take an inspired approach to their work, renewing their experience of it as a creative, participative, and purposeful endeavor. There are seven basic assumptions of the concept of Artful Work: o All Work Can Be Artful o The Reward for Artful Work Is In the Doing o The Ambition of Artful Work Is Joy o All Work Is Spiritual Work o Artistry Demands That the Artist Own the Work Process o Artful Work Requires Consistent and Conscious Use of the Self o As the Artist Makes the Work, the Work Makes the Artist Artful Work sets forth an entirely new way of thinking about all of the work we do, and the organizations that contain our work. It offers a compelling guide to honoring artistry in our work, organizations, and leadership roles, and creating workplaces that truly honor our passion. It speaks to the courageous and hopeful among us who seek to make our work and workplaces more joyful and productive."

1220,"Photojournalism is a demanding art, even more so for female photographers than for their male colleagues: Along with the perils, and discomforts shared by every professional traveler, women all too often face other obstacles unique to their gender. But as this gloriously colorful celebration proves, the women of National Geographic have excelled behind the camera for almost a century, come hell or high water, documenting the world in arresting images that linger long in the viewer's eye.  From Eliza Scidmore, whose 1914 hand-tinted portrait immortalizes a Japanese child framed by chrysanthemums on page 18, to such famous names as Margaret Bourke-White and Dickey Chapelle, to the most gifted eyes of today, Women Photographers at National Geographic is a gallery of some 40 extraordinary visual talents and their finest work. Cathy Newman's informative text chronicles the adventures, achievements, and observations of four generations of remarkable, resourceful women: Annie Griffiths Belt, who passed herself off as a boy to capture a ceremony closed to women in Israel; Bourke-White, a figure of such romance and élan that she inspired the television movie Double Exposure; plucky Dorothy Hosmer, whose pictures documented her 1937 bicycle tour of Romania -- and almost went unpublished because a prim male editor found the very idea unladylike.  But the pièce de résistance is of course the photography, both in rich color and evocatively nuanced black and white: Landscapes like Edith Watson's view of Cape Breton island early in the century...portraits like Jodi Cobb's Saudi beauty, veiled but for flashing sloe eyes...scenes of lethal beauty like Dickey Chapelle's fiery Vietnamese nightmare, published only after she was killed in the field...and over 140 more, from a majestic quintet of elephants to a long-ago schoolroom of solemn, shaven-headed Russian village boys. Interspersed among the chapters are showcase portfolios of five superb contemporary women photographers, whose personal essays explore their visions and hallmark themes: ""Women on Women"" by Jodi Cobb, Maria Stenzel's ""Art of Adventure,"" Annie Griffiths Belt on ""Intimacy,"" Karen Kasmauski's gallery of ""The Human Condition,"" and Sisse Brimberg's reflections on how one links the gap ""Across Cultures.""  As Tipper Gore aptly observes in her Foreword, ""This book marks an important milestone for photography in America. I can think of no better way to begin the millennium."" Open this splendid volume to any page and you'll find the stunning proof in image after image you'll never forget."
1221,"Tom Peters--brilliant, original, and perhaps the most inspiring and listened-to business thinker of our time--has a lot on his mind these days. And he wants to share it in The Circle of Innovation. The world of business is in a permanent state of flux, he argues, a state of chaos in which constant innovation is the only survival strategy--for the individual and for the organization. And he presents here a lifesaving handbook--both provocative and practical--designed to turn any organization into a perpetual innovation machine.In 400 seminars in 47 states and 22 countries in the last five years, Peters has reexamined, refined, and reinvented his views on innovation. Now he brings those seminars--and his passion--to the reader in a landmark book. It is meant, he writes, to both ""terrify"" and ""enlighten."" These are ""times of matchless peril for those who fail to grasp the nettle...and times of matchless opportunity for those who do.""To keep us alert, limber, and ready for action, he provokes and cajoles in chapter after chapter. Among his institutions and revelations:We Are All Michelangelos. He shows how to transform every ""jobholder"" into a full-fledged businessperson.All Value Comes from the Professional Services. How to convert sluggish staff units into Vital Centers of Intellectual Capital Accumulation.The System is the Solution.

Why transformational leaders of the future must have laser-like focus, tell the truth, and live on the lunatic fringe.The hallmarks of Tom Peters legend are an insatiable curiosity, an agile intellect, a pragmatic perspective, and an uncanny ability to gauge the global zeitgeist. These qualities are all brought to bear as Peters sets out to engage, enrage, and ultimately empower his readers, amid forces that are reshaping not only business but every aspect of human experience."

1224,"The origins of life on earth, the workings of the human mind, the mysteries of the Universe itself--profound questions such as these were once the province of philosophy and theology alone. Today they have become the staple--and indeed the hallmark--of the finest writing about science. And few science writers have tackled the big questions as persistently and as insightfully as astronomer John Barrow.        Now, in Between Inner Space and Outer Space, Barrow brings together dozens of essays that offer a sweeping account of his explorations along the boundary lines of science, philosophy, and religion.  Here is an invigorating tour of topics such as cosmology, evolution, Grand Unified Theories, complexity and chaos, the nature of time, super string theory, quantum mechanics, particle physics, Big Bang theory, and much more.  Barrow's range is remarkable. He examines, for instance, what science can tell us about our love of music or why certain paintings appeal to us. He recounts the dramatic discoveries made by the satellite COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) and reveals what these findings tell us about the origins of the Cosmos. He discusses the debate over the nature of the universe waged by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose. And he offers a thoughtful review of E.O. Wilson's Consilience, seconding Wilson's criticism of social scientists who remain quite ignorant of the key insights made by the life sciences.          Leavened with a sprightly sense of humor, Between Inner Space and Outer Space illuminates modern science as it provides much food for thought about life's ultimate questions."

1238,"AN INSPIRATIONAL MEDITATION ON THE POWER OF CONSCIENCE—HOW A SIMPLE ACT, A MOMENT OF PURPOSE, CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE, YOUR COMMUNITY, EVEN THE WORLDWe all struggle at times to know what to do to seek and abide our conscience—when right and wrong are not black and white, when heart and head speak with different voices, when our intentions and interests are not aligned. If you believe that the outcome of these struggles affects the course of your life, and the lives around you, then this book is for you.If you believe that there are times and places when the choice an individual makes to speak or be silent, to eat or fast, to remain seated or to stand up in a crowd, to stare and remember or to walk on by and forget, can be as powerful as a president’s command, a congressional appropriation, or a military incursion, then this book is for you.This book is for you if your profession is rewarding financially but not spiritually, or if you’re ever worried that your career and conscience conflict.This book is for you if you are a parent whose love of your children never wavers with the anxiety they cause you but sometimes leaves you wondering whether they will grow up to do the right thing even if no one is watching.This book is for you if you question whether the countless small decisions you make each day add up to a larger judgment about your life’s meaning.Finally, this book is for you if you believe that quiet, often solitary acts of conscience have echoes louder than the original sound; that individual acts have the potential to trigger large public consequences and continue to inspire others from generation to generation; that such acts bring rewards to the individual, that unforeseen benefits accrue, that one gains more than was sacrificed, and that there is a transformative power and richness to a life so lived."
1239,"As A Boy, Claude Rawlings looks up through the grated window of his basement apartment to watch the world go by. Poor, lonely, supported by a taxi-driver mother whose eccentricities spin more and more out of control, he faces the terrible task of growing up on the margins of life, destined to be a spectator of that great world always hurrying out of reach. But there is an out-of-tune piano in the small apartment, and in unlocking the secrets of its keys, as if by magic, Claude discovers himself. He is a musical prodigy.Body & Soul is the story of a young man whose life is transformed by a gift. The gift is not without price - the work is relentless, the teachers exacting - but the reward is a journey that takes him to the drawing rooms of the rich and powerful, private schools, a gilt-edged marriage, and Carnegie Hall. Claude moves through this life as if he were playing a difficult composition, swept up in its drama and tension, surprised by its grace notes. Music, here, becomes a character in its own right, equaled in strength only by the music of Frank Conroy's own unmistakable and true voice.Bristling with character and invention, Body & Soul is Dickensian in its range and richness. This is a novel with all the emotional appeal and moral gravity of a classic bildungsroman, but with a tone as contemporary as a jazz riff - an unforgettable achievement by one of the great writers of our time."
1240,"Only a small percentage of the sixteen million servicemen called up during World War II saw front-line service. For the others, war involved training, reinforcement depots, tedious assignments, and lots of waiting. Herman J. Obermayer was one of those who earned a combat star without ever coming close enough to a battlefront to hear or see booming guns. Nonetheless, his letters then, and his reflection on them now, reveal important aspects of the war and the wartime world. From school, from basic training, and later from Europe, Obermayer wrote home with vivid descriptions of life in the Army. Reflective and observant, he recorded his views of both French and German reactions to the American occupation force, race relations among enlisted men, and the problems of supplying the troops as they crossed Europe after the Normandy invasion. One of the few people alive today to have seen Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess, and other leaders of Third Reich, Obermayer wrote compellingly about the Nazis on trial at Nuremberg, describing Goering’s leadership qualities when stripped of the symbols of rank. A Jew himself, Obermayer explained his reactions at the trials when he witnessed the first documentary confirmation that six million Jews had been killed in the Holocaust. He knew and wrote about the official U.S. Army hangman at Nuremberg. Readers will find in Obermayer’s letters and connective commentary a welcome tendency to look for what went on beneath the surface, a challenging view of how his experiences cast light on today’s politics and issues, and an engrossingly human story of war behind the lines."

Are you sick and tired of the tax-cutting, environment-desecrating, secret-keeping, influence-peddling, war-mongering, free speech-hating hypocrites who occupy America's halls of power? If so, you have company -- James Carville.Like James Carville, America has been bruised and battered by the Republicans who are running our country and running it into the ground. The Bush administration has squandered a five-trillion-dollar surplus and created a five-trillion-dollar projected deficit. Their tax cut for the rich was supposed to create jobs -- but instead America has lost more than three million of them. This administration was supposed to bring honor and dignity to the White House but instead brought lies, leaks, secrecy, and fear. They promised to make the country stronger and safer but instead they've left us overstretched, isolated, and insecure.And Carville has had enough.In Had Enough? the legendary political adviser comes out of his corner swinging, taking on the Bush White House and the Republican leaders in Congress on every front -- from the economy to education to foreign affairs.

Mirror Mirror is the fascinating story of the mirror's invention, refinement, and use in an astonishing range of human activities--from the fantastic mirrored rooms that wealthy Romans created for their orgies to the mirror's key role in the use and understanding of light. Pendergrast spins tales of the 2,500year mystery of whether Archimedes and his ""burning mirror"" really set faraway Roman ships on fire; the medieval Venetian glassmakers, who perfected the technique of making large, flat mirrors from clear glass and for whom any attempt to leave their cloistered island was punishable by death; Isaac Newton, whose experiments with sunlight on mirrors once left him blinded for three days; the artist David Hockney, who holds controversial ideas about Renaissance artists and their use of optical devices; and George Ellery Hale, the manic-depressive astronomer and telescope enthusiast who inspired (and gave his name to) the twentieth century's largest ground-based telescope. Like mirrors themselves, Mirror Mirror is a book of endless wonder and fascination."

George Carlin's hilarious When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? offers his cutting-edge opinions and observational humor on everything from evasive euphemistic language to politicians to the media to dead people. Nothing and no one is safe!Despite the current climate of political correctness, Carlin is not afraid to take on controversial topics:Carlin on the media: The media comprises equal parts business, politics, advertising, public relations, and show business. Nice combination. Enough bull for Texas to open a chain of branch offices.Carlin on the battle of the sexes: Here's all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid.Carlin on hygiene: When did they pass a law that says the people who make my sandwich have to be wearing gloves? I'm not comfortable with this. I don't want glove residue all over my food; it's not sanitary. Who knows where these gloves have been? Carlin on evasive language: Just to demonstrate how far using euphemisms in language has gone, some psychologists are now actually referring to ugly people as those with ""severe appearance deficits."" Hey, Doctor. How's that for ""denial""?Carlin on politics: No self-respecting politician would ever admit to working in the government. They prefer to think of themselves ""serving the nation."" To help visualize the service they provide the country, you may wish to picture the things that take place on a stud farm.The thinking person's comic who uses words as weapons, Carlin puts voice to issues that capture the modern imagination. For instance, why are there Ten Commandments? Are UFOs real? What will the future really be like? This brand-new collection tackles all that and more.In When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? Carlin's razor-sharp observations demolish everyday values and leave you laughing out loud--delivering exactly what his countless fans have been waiting for."

How have armies been fed throughout history? The Reader's Companion to Military History addresses these and other intriguing aspects of the most destructive, fascinating, and relentless of human enterprises -- war. Filled with surprising anecdotes, little-known facts, and rare illustrations, The Reader's Companion to Military History covers major events and battles, commanders and theorists, weaponry and technological advances, and strategy and tactics. What makes the volume especially distinctive, however, is the range of thematic articles, covering such topics as courage, discipline, the effects of weather on warfare, military justice, surrender, the role of propaganda, the use of animals in war, the evolution of uniforms, psychological warfare, and morale. Unlike many military histories, the volume covers Asian, African, and South American history as well that of Europe and North America. Subjects range from the Persian Wars of 490 B.C. to such contemporary topics such as the revelations of Robert McNamara, gays in the military, and ethnic cleansing. One hundred fifty distinguished military historians, biographers, and journalists produced this volume under the editorship of Robert Cowley, editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History, and Geoffrey Parker, Robert A.

1271,"Respected psychologist Dr. Brad Sachs helps parents to recognize their unrealistic expectations for their teenagers and to love, accept and nurture the family they have to its full potential. His approach frees them to discover acceptance of themselves and of their children. The ages twelve to eighteen are often the most challenging and trying years for adolescents––and their parents. No other phase of life is characterized by so much physical and psychological change happening so quickly. And frequently the child parents had loved and understood becomes a teenager they hardly recognize––the child who loved music grows into a teen who wants to play video games rather than the piano; or the little girl who loved dolls becomes a teen who loves staying out with her older, rebellious boyfriend. The Good Enough Teen, however, shows you how to see your child's evolution as a window of opportunity––for you, for your child, and for your entire family. Rather than having you brace for your offspring's adolescence with your eyes shut and your jaw clenched, this book will help you to understand the invisible transformation teens are experiencing, as well as the ways in which your own adolescence intimately influences this understanding. You will find yourself better able to see even your child's most exasperating behaviours as steps in his or her striving towards maturity, rather than chronic problems or mean–spirited efforts designed to make you miserable. The Good Enough Teen presents a developmental overview of what parents can expect from their children during adolescence, then delineates the five stages in the journey towards accepting a child for who he or she is. With prescriptive tools and strategies for parents, including checklists, quizzes, and exercises, and numerous case studies from the author's own practice, The Good Enough Teen is vital help for any parent with a teenager."

An antique bridal quilt, which appeared under mysterious circumstances in the vintage clothing shop where Rachel worked, it drew her as if it had been made for her. It was beautiful, mesmerizing ... almost eerily fascinating. She little dreamed that it might hold secrets better left undisturbed.Rachel had never been able to resist the allure of finely crafted textiles from times gone by. Her research into women's crafts led her to believe that through the ages women had woven protective magic into the fabric of all they fashioned for their rites of passage: birth, marriage, and death.It never occurred to Rachel that the same power used to protect could also be used to harm. But day by day she saw and felt the power grow - the quilt was influencing her thoughts, her actions. And this was not the benign white magic of her imagination. Much as Rachel's rational mind longed to deny such an uncanny phenomenon, the aura of evil emanating from the quilt was all too frighteningly real. The carefully crafted heirloom carried a sinister legacy into the present, something that threatened to destroy the people Rachel loved."

1310,"In many ways, the Northern soldier in the Civil War fought as if he had never left home.  On campsites and battlefields, the Union volunteer adapted to military life with attitudes shaped by networks of family relationships, in units of men from the same hometown.  Understanding these links between the homes the troops left behind and the war they had to fight, writes Reid Mitchell, offers critical insight into how they thought, fought, and persevered through four bloody years of combat. In The Vacant Chair, Mitchell draws on the letters, diaries, and memoirs of common soldiers to show how mid-nineteenth-century ideas and images of the home and family shaped the union soldier's approach to everything from military discipline to battlefield bravery.  For hundreds of thousands of ""boys,"" as they called themselves, the Union army was an extension of their home and childhood experiences.  Many experienced the war as a coming-of-age rite, a test of such manly virtues as self-control, endurance, and courage.  They served in companies recruited from the same communities, and they wrote letters reporting on each other's performance--conscious that their own behavior in the army would affect their reputations back home.  So, too, were they deeply affected by letters from their families, as wives and mothers complained of suffering or demanded greater valor.  Mitchell also shows how this hometown basis for volunteer units eroded respect for military rank, as men served with officers they saw as equals: ""Lieut Col Dewey introduced Hugh T Reid,"" one sergeant wrote dryly, ""by saying, 'Boys, behold your colonel,' and webeheldhim.""  In return, officers usually adopted paternalist attitudes toward their ""boys""--especially in the case of white officers commanding black soldiers.  Mitchell goes on to look at the role of women in the soldiers' experiences, from the feminine center of their own households to their hatred of Confederate women as ""she-devils."" The intimate relations and inner life of the Union soldier, the author writes, tell us much about how and why he kept fighting through four bloody years--and why demoralization struck the Confederate soldier as the war penetrated the South, threatening his home and family while he was at the front. ""The Northern soldier did not simply experience the war as a husband, son, father, or brother--he fought that way as well,"" he writes.  ""That was part of his strength.  The Confederate soldier fought the war the same way, and, in the end, that proved part of his weakness.""  The Vacant Chair uncovers this critical chapter in the Civil War experience, showing how the Union soldier saw--and won--our most costly conflict."

1328,"A fascinating collection of revealing and entertaining interviews by the award-winning host of National Public Radio's premier interview program Fresh Air.Over the last twenty years, Terry Gross has interviewed many of our most celebrated writers, actors, musicians, comics, and visual artists. Her show, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, a weekday magazine of contemporary arts and issues produced by WHYY in Philadelphia, is one of National Public Radio's most popular programs. More than four million people tune in to the show, which is broadcast on over 400 NPR stations across the country.Gross is known for her thoughtful, probing interviewing style. In her trusted company, even the most reticent guest relaxes and opens up. But Gross doesn't shy away from controversy, and her questions can be tough--too tough, apparently, for Bill O'Reilly, who abruptly terminated his conversation with her. Her interview with Gene Simmons of Kiss, which is included in the book, prompted Entertainment Weekly to name Simmons its male ""Crackpot of the Year.""For All I Did Was Ask, Gross has selected more than three dozen of her best interviews--ones of lasting relevance that are as lively on the page as they were on the air. Each is preceded by a personal introduction in which she reveals why a particular guest was on the show and the thinking behind some of her questions. And in an introductory chapter, the normally self-effacing Gross does something you're unlikely ever to hear her do on Fresh Air--she discusses her approach to interviewing, revealing a thing or two about herself in the bargain.The collection focuses on luminaries from the art and entertainment world, including actors, comedians, writers, visual artists, and musicians, such as:  Conan O'Brien  Chris Rock  Michael Caine  Dennis Hopper  Dustin Hoffman  Jodie Foster  John Updike  Mary Karr  Mario Puzo  Nick Hornby  Chuck Close  Eric Clapton  George Clinton  Sonny Rollins  Samuel L. Jackson  Johnny Cash  Isabella Rossellini  Divine  Uta Hagen  Carol Shields"

1334,"By moving China to center stage, Robert Smith Thompson expands the traditional boundaries of the Pacific Theater of World War II and casts the conflict in an entirely new light. What is commonly viewed as a discrete military conflict between an aggressive Japan with imperial ambitions and a reluctant, passive America now becomes the stuff of Greek tragedy. The overreaching British Empire is waning, yet is unwilling to relinquish its foothold in China, while an increasingly ambitious Japan is determined to dominate the region and conquer China as part of that plan. Enter the young upstart, America, with imperial ambitions of its own in Asia. The United States meant to replace Britain as the dominant power in Asia and saw Japan as a direct threat to that dominance. For Franklin Delano Roosevelt and for the United States, the war with Japan had little to do with revenge for Pearl Harbor. Japan would have to be vanquished so that it would never again be an imperial rival.This recasting of the Asian conflict profoundly alters our understanding not just of World War II in the Pacific but also of what followed in the Korean War and the war in Vietnam. Revisionist history at its best, Empires on the Pacific will provoke discussion and debate and it will alter our view of what many still consider the last ""good war.""Interest in WWII has never been higher: The summertime release of Touchstone Pictures' blockbuster Pearl Harbor-accompanied by Basic Books' own Pearl Harbor (April 19 release)-will create tremendous interest in the Pacific theater of WWII. Timely publication: The book anticipates the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 2001. Striking, revisionist, controversial: America's wartime actions in the Pacific were not revenge for Pearl Harbor but were part of America's larger imperial ambitions to replace the British Empire as the dominant force in Asia, and, especially, in China. America won the war with Japan but lost the peace, which led, inevitably, to the Korean War and to the war in Vietnam. A long overdue explanation of what America's war against Japan was all about-in a word: China."

1348,"The American Dream is in decline. Americans are increasingly overworked, underpaid, and squeezed for time. But there is an alternative: the European Dream-a more leisurely, healthy, prosperous, and sustainable way of life. Europe's lifestyle is not only desirable, argues Jeremy Rifkin, but may be crucial to sustaining prosperity in the new era.     With the dawn of the European Union, Europe has become an economic superpower in its own right-its GDP now surpasses that of the United States. Europe has achieved newfound dominance not by single-mindedly driving up stock prices, expanding working hours, and pressing every household into a double- wage-earner conundrum. Instead, the New Europe relies on market networks that place cooperation above competition; promotes a new sense of citizenship that extols the well-being of the whole person and the community rather than the dominant individual; and recognizes the necessity of deep play and leisure to create a better, more productive, and healthier workforce.   From the medieval era to modernity, Rifkin delves deeply into the history of Europe, and eventually America, to show how the continent has succeeded in slowly and steadily developing a more adaptive, sensible way of working and living. In The European Dream, Rifkin posits a dawning truth that only the most jingoistic can ignore: Europe's flexible, communitarian model of society, business, and citizenship is better suited to the challenges of the twenty-first century. Indeed, the European Dream may come to define the new century as the American Dream defined the century now past."

But sixteen-hour days spent hauling heavy cargo aboard tugs and icebreakers along the frozen arctic offshore (not to mention smoking copious amounts of Cannabis indica) can warp a man’s sense of reality. Desperate for real human contact, he tunes the sideband radio to 2182 kHz (twenty-one eighty-two kilohertz), the international distress channel, in the vague hope of finding someone he can save.  Soon, though, even the paycheck that fattens his wallet each season isn’t enough to fix his interest. Seine journeys south, but weathers a capsizing that leaves his fellow crewmen dead. Unable to break from his old habits, and haunted by the ghosts of dead shipmates, he flies north for another season. One day, idly monitoring 2182, Seine catches a fading distress call from somewhere out in the circumpolar twilight. A scientist named Louis Moneymaker is trapped alone on an ice floe that threatens to melt beneath his feet. Cobbling together a motley rescue team–the frostbitten Wolf, a six-foot-eight Russian known as Big Man, a tattooed Eskimo nicknamed the Buff, and an intrepid, dark-eyed sailor named Julia–Seine travels farther north than he’s ever gone, determined to save Moneymaker and exorcise his demons in one grand sweep.  2182 kHz combines the white-knuckle adventure of The Perfect Storm with the dark humor and deadpan wit of Chuck Palahniuk to create an absorbing tale of search-and-rescue.

1365,"In between Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan there was Joe Namath, one of the  few sports heroes to transcend the game he played. Novelist and former sports-columnist Mark Kriegel’s bestselling biography of the iconic quarterback details his journey from steel-town pool halls to the upper reaches of American celebrity—and beyond. The first of his kind, Namath enabled a nation to see sports as show biz. For an entire generation he became a spectacle of booze and broads, a guy who made bachelorhood seem an almost sacred calling, but it was his audacious “guarantee” of victory in Super Bowl III that ensured his legend. This unforgettable portrait brings readers from the gridiron to the go-go nightclubs as Kriegel uncovers the truth behind Broadway Joe and why his legend has meant so much to so many."

1369,"A BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN IRRITATED, IGNORED, AMUSES, OR PERPLEXED BY THE FRENCH.French cuisine, French style, and French wine are internationally renowned and familiar, but for most of the English-speaking world, the French people remain an enigma. In his engaging, eye-opening book, Theodore Zeldin introduces scores of French men, women, and children to answer the questions that confound every visitor to France: When do you laugh at a Frenchman's stories and when should you look solemn? How can you tell what a French person wants to achieve in a business negotiation? Why do they treat foreigners so rudely? These and other conundrums are resolved as Zeldin explores the emotions and assumptions behind the façade of this complex and contradictory society. Both erudite and entertaining, The French is illuminating to visitors, indispensable to anyone doing business in the country, and delightful reading for anyone fascinated by the land of Asterix, Descartes, Proust, and Bardot."
1370,"England 1819. Two enigmatic Americans arrive in London and soon after a bank collapses. A man is found dead on a building site; another goes missing in the teeming stews of the city's notorious Seven Dials district. A deathbed vigil ends in an act of theft, and a beautiful heiress flirts with her inferiors. A strange destiny connects each of these events to an American boy, Edgar Allan Poe, who was brought to England by his foster father and sent to the leafy village of Stoke Newington to be educated.An Unpardonable Crime is a twenty-first-century novel with a nineteenth-century voice. It is both a multilayered literary murder mystery and a love story, its setting ranging from the coal-scented fogs of late-Regency London to the stark winter landscapes of Gloucestershire. And at its center is the boy who does not really belong anywhere, an actor who never learns the significance of his part."
1371,"There is a great myth that Britain and America have always been the closest of allies, standing side by side in times of trouble, helping each other unquestionably and with a shared sense of united destiny. In his grand Fighting with Allies, former British ambassador Sir Robin Renwick illuminates as never before the tensions and battles that have defined the Anglo-American ""special relationship.""Beginning in the early nineteenth century, Renwick goes behind the scenes to give us dramatic and revealing portraits of the personalities and events that have shaped the two nations. Drawing liberally on first-person accounts, private letters, and diaries, Renwick has crafted a narrative that manages to be intimate and personal even as it takes us through some of the most exciting and spectacular events of the past century and a half. Renwick's cast of characters is astonishing, and among those we meet are Rear Admiral George Cockburn, who burned the White House to the ground during the War of 1812; Theodore Roosevelt, who found intellectual inspiration in Rudyard Kipling; Woodrow Wilson, who declared America ""too proud to fight""; Lloyd George, who patronized the Americans even as he began to realize that they would become the greater power; Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill (himself half American), who brought the alliance together to face the greatest threat the world had ever known; Harry Truman, who found himself caught in a delicate balancing act between Stalin and Churchill; Clement Attlee, who defeated Churchill for the prime ministership and then, with Truman and Dean Acheson, helped preside over the formation of NATO and the reluctant transformation of British Palestine into the state of Israel; Dwight Eisenhower, whom Churchill blamed for the failure of Allied forces to occupy Berlin and Prague; Anthony Eden, who doubted America's capacities in international affairs; John F. Kennedy, whose close friendship with Harold Macmillan brought the alliance to a new stage; Harold Wilson, accused of servility toward Lyndon Johnson, whose Vietnam nightmare threatened relations; Richard Nixon, who correctly predicted Wilson's downfall only to find that Edward Heath saw British interests to be more with Europe than with America; Jimmy Carter, whose own foreign policy was crippled by internal debates and debacles; Margaret Thatcher, who found a soul mate in Ronald Reagan and helped the alliance reach its strongest point in decades; George Bush, who shifted America's focus from Britain to Europe; and Bill Clinton and John Major, both confronted with a bloody war in the Balkans and unsure how to deal with it."

1373,"This memoir of Woodrow Wilson is a long-neglected treasure, full of the candid and perceptive observations of Wilson's brother-in-law and close friend, Stockton Axson. A charming and talented scholar of English literature, Axson became one of the few people in whom the reticent Wilson confided freely. Axson and Wilson met in 1884, when Wilson was courting Axson's sister Ellen, while Axson was still a school boy. The friendship of the two men ended only with the president's death in 1924. Axson's fondness for his mentor, ""Brother Woodrow,"" pervades this account, but he is frank in his analysis of Wilson's flaws. As one of only a few personal memoirs of Wilson, this book offers a uniquely intimate view of the ""human side"" of the introverted president--and a sensitive evocation of the social life of a bygone era.Axson begins with memories of Wilson's father and of Wilson's life as a young man, including his engagement and marriage to Ellen Axson and his early teaching posts. Wilson taught for twelve years at Princeton University before his accession to its presidency, and Axson also taught there during this period. After Wilson began his stormy career as president of Princeton, Axson's bachelor quarters were often a meeting place for the ""Wilson faction."" His lucid analysis of Wilson's successes and failures as Princeton's president is one of the highlights of the book--and probably the best record of these years of Wilson's life.The book ends with a look behind the scenes of Wilson's career as governor of New Jersey and president of the United States, and an analysis of the growing complexity of his personality. ""It is Uncle Joseph [Wilson's father] in him,"" observed one relative of Wilson's seeming rigidity. From the standpoint of a loving family member, Axson offers a penetrating but sympathetic report on how Wilson changed as he bore the terrible burdens of World War I and its aftermath.Originally published in 1993.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These paperback editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905."
1374,Tells how a patient's own capabilities for overcoming illness resulted in a recovery from a supposedly irreversible disease
1375,"Abraham Lincoln's remarkable emergence from the rural Midwest and his rise to the presidency have been the stuff of romance and legend. But as Douglas L. Wilson shows us in Honor's Voice, Lincoln's transformation was not one long triumphal march, but a process that was more than once seriously derailed. There were times, in his journey from storekeeper and mill operator to lawyer and member of the Illinois state legislature, when Lincoln lost his nerve and self-confidence - on at least two occasions he became so despondent as to appear suicidal - and when his acute emotional vulnerabilities were exposed.Focusing on the crucial years between 1831 and 1842, Wilson's skillful analysis of the testimonies and writings of Lincoln's contemporaries reveals the individual behind the legends. We see Lincoln as a boy: not the dutiful son studying by firelight, but the stubborn rebel determined to make something of himself. We see him as a young man: not the ascendant statesman, but the canny local politician who was renowned for his talents in wrestling and storytelling (as well as for his extensive store of off-color jokes). Wilson also reconstructs Lincoln's frequently anguished personal life: his religious skepticism, recurrent bouts of depression, and difficult relationships with women - from Ann Rutledge to Mary Owens to Mary Todd.Meticulously researched and well written, this is a fascinating book that makes us reexamine our ideas about one of the icons of American history."

1378,"America listens to Jim Hightower. More than eighty thousand people subscribe to The Hightower Lowdown Newsletter while his radio show is aired on more than sixty public and commercial radio stations.  In They've Stolen Our Country and It's Time To Take It Back, he takes on the Bushites, the Wobblycrats, and the corporate Kleptocrats, digging up behind-the-scenes dirt that the corporate media overlooks-like BushCo's ""Friday Night Massacres,"" what's happened to our food, and the Bush plan for empire. But the book also offers grassroots solutions, drawing on Hightower's Rolling Thunder Down-Home Democracy Tour, a traveling festival of rebellion against every tentacle of the corporate-politico power grab. At kitchen tables all over America, Hightower has tapped into the thriving activist networks that are our country's grassroots muscle, and his book tells their uplifting stories of retaking control of their communities. This is the real America that the rest of the world doesn't get to see.  With his unique blend of wit and outrage, Jim Hightower ""lights a prairie fire""-and it's just the spark that his growing national audience craves."

1380,"The Entities came, quite literally, out of nowhere, landing in cities all across our Earth: Los Angeles, London, New York, Beijing. Fifteen feet tall and indescribably beautiful - or unbelievably hideous, depending on your point of view - the alien invaders treated humankind in the worst way imaginable.They ignored us. They made no attempt to communicate with us. Walling themselves in impenetrable enclaves, enslaving a few willing collaborators with their telepathic PUSH, they casually plunged the rest of the Earth into a new Dark Age without electricity. Our few pathetic attempts at fighting back resulted in murderous plagues and mass executions, quickly convincing us that resistance was futile. The Entities' silent message was clear: We were allowed to live, but no longer as a dominant species.But a few refused to believe. Among them were the Carmichaels: a far-flung family of aviators, soldiers, misfits, hustlers, and hackers. As the world darkened into chaos around them, they gathered in their enclave in the hills of Santa Barbara, led by a patriarchal colonel who had learned to hate war in Vietnam and found himself devoting his life, and the lives of his descendants, to keeping the idea of resistance alive. The colonel's legacy is carried on by an unlikely team: an aging hippie, a cold-blooded Muslim assassin, a prodigal son, and a renegade hacker all united in spirit, who will penetrate the inner halls of cyberspace to kill the mysterious Prime Entity and free the planet the rest of us have all but forgotten how to love."

1382,"On the last Sunday of February 1859, Dan Sickles, a charming young congressman from New York, murdered his good friend Philip Barton Key (son of Francis Scott Key) - who was also his wife's lover - in Washington's Lafayette Square. The shooting took place directly across the street from the White House, the home of Sickles's friend and protector, President James Buchanan. Sickles turned himself in; political friends in New York's Tammany Hall machinery, including the dynamic criminal lawyer James Brady, quickly gathered around. While his beautiful young wife was banned from public life and shunned by society, Dan Sickles was acquitted.American Scoundrel is the story of this powerful mid-nineteenth-century politician and inveterate womanizer, whose irresistible charms and rock-solid connections not only allowed him to get away with murder - literally - but also paved the way to a stunning career."

1384,"Have you tried sewing with no needles and no thread? Introduce yourself to fusible sewing--the stitchless, press-on way to make clothes, decorations, and gifts. Simply place adhesives between two layers of fabric and secure them with a touch of your iron. With fusibles, once difficult, time-consuming tasks are finished quickly, easily, and with professional results. Some adhesives iron directly onto cloth, others come with a paper backing that protects it and the fabric from your iron. You'll find lots of situations where fusibles are better than sewing, including seaming two layers of fabric, hemming a raw edge, binding a cut edge, and applying trim, fringe, or tassels. And, for times when you don't want a seam to show, fusibles are the perfect solution. With fusibles you can also create no-sew appliques, make perfect covered cording, and laminate a fabric. Projects featured here include pillows, place mats, shower curtains, box covers, desk sets, reversible curtains, sofa throws, and many imaginative  gifts.  128 pages (all in color), 8 1/2 x 10.

1385,"He was a pioneer in modern law enforcement, a trailblazing leader in the hunt for serial killers. But after decades of staring deep into the darkness, he entered a seminary to search for the good... BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL No one gets closer to evil than a criminal profiler, trained to penetrate the hearts and minds of society's most vicious psychopaths. And no one is a more towering figure in the world of criminal profilers than Roger L. Depue. Chief of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit at a time when its innovative work first came to prominence, he headed a renowned team of mind hunters that included John Douglas, Robert Ressler, and Roy Hazelwood. In a subbasement sixty feet under the Academy gun vault in Quantico, he broke new ground with analytical techniques and training programs that are still used today. After retiring from the FBI, he founded an elite forensics group that consulted on high-profile cases, including the Martha Moxley and JonBenet Ramsey murders, and the Columbine school shootings. But coming face-to-face with the darkest deeds human beings are capable of took a horrific toll. After suffering a devastating personal loss, Depue, on the brink of despair, walked away from the outside world and joined a seminary. For three years this was his safe haven, a place where he exorcised personal demons and found a refuge from terrifying memories of real-life monsters. And it was there, while counseling maximum security inmates, that he rediscovered the capacity for goodness in people, and made the decision to return to the world to resume his work. Here is Depue's extraordinary personal account, from growing up as a police officer's son to tracking down some of today's most brutal murderers. With its harrowing descriptions of human depravity and passionate call to fight against evil, BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL is both a riveting dispatch from the front lines of a war against human predators...and the powerful story of one man's journey between darkness and redemption."

1398,"Alexandroff's beautiful and elegant introduction to topology was originally published in 1932 as an extension of certain aspects of Hilbert's Anschauliche Geometrie. The text has long been recognized as one of the finest presentations of the fundamental concepts, vital for mathematicians who haven't time for extensive study and for beginning investigators.The book is not a substitute for a systematic text, but an unusually useful intuitive approach to the basic concepts. Its aim is to present these concepts in a clear, elementary fashion without sacrificing their profundity or exactness and to give some indication of how they are useful in increasingly more areas of mathematics. The author proceeds from the basics of set-theoretic topology, through those topological theorems and questions which are based upon the concept of the algebraic complex, to the concept of Betti groups which binds together central topological theories in a whole and upon which applications of topology largely rest.Wholly consistent with current investigations, in which a larger and larger part of topology is governed by the concept of homology, the book deals primarily with the concepts of complex, cycle, and homology. It points the way toward a systematic and entirely geometrically oriented theory of the most general structures of space.First English translation, prepared for Dover by Alan E. Farley. Preface by David Hilbert. Author's Foreword. Index. 25 figures."

1400,"In Pale Horse Coming the unforgettable Earl Swagger returns in a searing follow-up to Hot Springs, Stephen Hunter's New York Times bestselling novel. It once again demonstrates why Hunter has been called ""the only modern writer who can lay claim to being Dashiell Hammett's immediate successor.""  It's 1951, and the last place in America any sane man wishes to visit is Thebes State Penal Farm (Colored) in Thebes, Mississippi. Up a dark river, surrounded by swamps and impenetrable piney woods, it's the Old South at its most brutal -- a place of violence, racial terror, and even more horrific rumors. Of the few who make the journey, black or white, even fewer return.  But in that year, two men will come to Thebes. The first is Sam Vincent, the former prosecuting attorney of Polk County, Arkansas. With great misgivings, Sam accepts a job from a smooth-talking Chicago lawyer to investigate a disappearance. Sam has heard of Thebes and knows that in the Negro culture he only imperfectly understands, the place has a special resonance of horror.  Sam is a careful man. Before he leaves on this dangerous trip, he confesses his fears to his former investigator Earl Swagger, a Marine hero on Iwo Jima, veteran of the mob wars in Hot Springs, and now a sergeant of the Arkansas State Police. Earl pledges that if Sam is not back by a certain time, he will come looking for him. Sam will bring his knowledge of the law, his compassion, and his sense of the rational to Thebes, but Earl will bring only his guns.  What they encounter there is something beyond their wildest imaginations for evil. The dying black town is ruled by white deputies on horseback who are more like an occupying army than a police force. Each citizen of the town is in debt to the Store, the one remaining civic institution, and the only escape is over the wild currents of the dark river that drowns as many people as it liberates.  But nothing in the town can prepare Earl for the prison itself where he becomes the first white inmate. It is a site of fear: Run by an aging madman with insane theories of racial purity, it is administered by a brutally efficient Stalin of a guard sergeant known as Bigboy. The convicts call him The Whip Man -- he can take a man's soul with his nine feet of braided catgut.  Both Sam and Earl will be challenged to the limits of their strength by this place and will struggle not only for their own survival, but with deeper questions: What does a man do when confronted with such evil? Can it be remedied? Can it be rectified, redirected, reformed?  Or must it just be destroyed? And if so, where would you find the men to destroy it?  Drawing on the oldest myths, classical and modern literature, popular culture at its most vigorous, and the Golden Age gun writers of the '50s, Pale Horse Coming is a stunning story of violence and retribution, written with the same high velocity of Hunter's classic thrillers Point of Impact, Dirty White Boys, Black Light, and Time to Hunt.  In Pale Horse Coming the unforgettable Earl Swagger returns in a searing follow-up to Hot Springs, Stephen Hunter's New York Times bestselling novel.

Drawing on the oldest myths, classical and modern literature, popular culture at its most vigorous, and the Golden Age gun writers of the '50s, Pale Horse Coming is a stunning story of violence and retribution, written with the same high velocity of Hunter's classic thrillers Point of Impact, Dirty White Boys, Black Light, and Time to Hunt."

1403,"A literary treasure, The Pirate Hunter is a masterpiece of historical detective work, and a rare, authentic pirate story for grown-ups. Captain Kidd has gone down in history as America's most ruthless buccaneer, fabulously rich, burying dozens of treasure chests up and down the eastern seaboard. But it turns out that most everyone, even many respected scholars, have the story all wrong. Captain William Kidd was no career cut-throat; he was a tough, successful New York sea captain who was hired to chase pirates. His three-year odyssey aboard the aptly named Adventure galley pitted him against arrogant Royal Navy commanders, jealous East India Company captains, storms, starvation, angry natives, and, above all, flesh-and-blood pirates. Superbly written and impeccably researched, The Pirate Hunter is one ripping good yarn."

1408,"One foggy evening, the most famous crime specialists in the world meet in an exclusive club, their minds on mystery. On the agenda, two tantalizing, unsolved cases of ghostly terror.   New York Times bestselling author and unsurpassed mater of suspense Barbara Michaels delivers a fireside page-turner in the grand tradition with her latest book,  Other Worlds.  The smoky room glows with a mix of cigars, brandy, and genius. Those present include Harry Houdini, king of illusion; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, father of the modern detective novel; Dr. Nandor Fodor, a psychoanalyst of international acclaim; and an elegant writer who can rival them all with her sleuthing talent.   These maters of mystery put their minds to a pair of gripping stories--of families beset by poltergeistly pranks and  bewitched by inexplicable horrors. Gripping puzzles, yes, but the terror is all too vicious and all too real.   In the hallows of Tennessee, a family is threatened by a dire spirit whose predictions of despair and death come frighteningly true.  In a small Connecticut town, a newly married widow and her children move into her second husband's home to find their lives possessed by an unimaginable demon. For the gathering at the club, a brilliant battle of wits is at hand. Were these villains phantoms from beyond or evildoers of flesh and blood? Each expert has a theory. Which of them is correct?  Whether writing as Barbara Michaels or Elizabeth Peters, this author is a master chef crafting richly atmospheric, suspense-filled delights. Other Worlds is an up-all-nighter, guaranteed to still haunt in the morning--a tale as chilling by daylight as it is by darkness."

In the idyllic serenity of their great house, Pemberley, we find Georgiana Darcy now under the happy tutelage of her young sister-in-law, Elizabeth Bennet Darcy. At seventeen years, she is just coming to womanhood.Georgiana, romantic by nature, has been wounded by her previous misadventure with Lieutenant George Wickham, and has vowed to give her heart to no man. Her vow, however, is sorely put to the test by the attentions of the gallant Captain Thomas Heywood, newly returned from the Naval Wars. No such threat is posed by James Leigh-Cooper, a brilliant architect engaged by Fitzwilliam Darcy for improvements upon his Derbyshire estate: this guileless, plain-spoken admirer somehow succeeds in nettling Georgiana at their every encounter.Meanwhile, the unfortunate Bennet clan is beset by its share of woes. Although both Elizabeth and Jane are now grandly married, a new scandal involving their foolish Aunt Philips of Meryton promises to ruin the family's reputation forever.How the Bennet name is cleared, and how Georgiana finds love after all, is a tale artfully unfolded in this enchanting tribute to England's best-loved novelist."

1416,"It lurks in the meat we eat. Undetectable, it incubates for years. It kills by eating holes in people's brains, so that they stagger and collapse and lose their minds. It's one hundred percent fatal. And it's already abroad in America. Deadly Feasts reads like a Michael Crichton thriller - but it's documented fact, bringing sober early warning of a new threat to our very lives that every one of us needs to heed.In this brilliant and gripping medical detective story, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes follows the daring explorations of maverick scientists as they track the emergence of the deadly ""stealth"" maladies known as prion diseases - strange new disease agents unlike any others known on earth. Mad cow disease is one. Besides hundreds of thousands of cattle, young people in Britain and France have already died from it - died from eating beef.Beginning with a cannibal feast in New Guinea only a few decades ago that killed everyone who partook, Rhodes shows this mysterious group of human and animal diseases spreading gradually throughout the world, infecting and killing laboratory animals; patients in surgery; herds of sheep, cattle, mink, deer and elk; children treated with human growth hormone; and now, ominously, healthy young people in Britain and on the Continent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announcement in early 1997 of drastic measures to prevent an outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States confirmed what Rhodes reveals and explores in detail: that Americans who eat meat are almost certainly already at risk."
1417,"Arthur Miller has been delivering powerful drama to the stage for decades with such masterpieces as Death of a Salesman. But, remarkably, no one has yet told the full story of Miller's own extraordinary life-a rich life, much of it shrouded from public view. To achieve this groundbreaking portrait of the artist and the man, the award-winning drama critic and biographer Martin Gottfried masterfully draws on his interviews with those who have known Miller throughout his personal and professional life, on Miller's voluminous lifelong correspondence, and on the annotated scripts and notebooks that reveal Miller's creative process in stunning detail. From Miller's childhood and adolescence in Depression-era New York City to his formative college years in Michigan…from the numerous early professional rejections to the 1947 play All My Sons that established him as a voice to be reckoned with…from his heroic defiance of the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy years to his most unlikely pairing with Marilyn Monroe… from political and social activism on the world stage to an extraordinary professional vitality even as he turns 88 in October 2003 (he is still writing plays, and stage revivals and film adaptations of his classics proliferate): here is a dazzling book-a literary event of the first order."

1424,"The charming true story of a spirited young woman who finds adventure--and the love of her life--in Paris.""This isn't like me. I'm not the sort of girl who crosses continents to meet up with a man she hardly knows. Paris hadn't even been part of my travel plan...""A delightful, fresh twist on the travel memoir, Almost French takes us on a tour that is fraught with culture clashes but rife with deadpan humor. Sarah Turnbull's stint in Paris was only supposed to last a week. Chance had brought Sarah and Frédéric together in Bucharest, and on impulse she decided to take him up on his offer to visit him in the world's most romantic city. Sacrificing Vegemite for vichyssoise, the feisty Sydney journalist does her best to fit in, although her conversation, her laugh, and even her wardrobe advertise her foreigner status. But as she navigates the highs and lows of this strange new world, from life in a bustling quatier and surviving Parisian dinner parties to covering the haute couture fashion shows and discovering the hard way the paradoxes of France today, little by little Sarah falls under its spell: maddening, mysterious, and charged with that French specialty-séduction.An entertaining tale of being a fish out of water, Almost French is an enthralling read as Sarah Turnbull leads us on a magical tour of this seductive place-and culture-that has captured her heart"

1427,"During the twenty-seven years of Nelson Mandela's imprisonment, Desmond Tutu served as the embodiment of hope for all the oppressed people of South Africa. Deprived of the right to vote (and virtually every other civil right), South Africa's people of color found their beloved archbishop to be a constant source of strength and courage in the wearing, year-in, year-out battle against the consummate evil of apartheid. So successful was Tutu in his great work that he became, as Nelson Mandela tells us in his Foreword, ""public enemy number one.""Here is the extraordinarily inspiring story of Desmond Tutu's decades-long struggle as the dedicated spokesman for one of the most important liberation movements of modern times, the anti-apartheid movement - as told by John Allen, the courageous journalist who became the archbishop's media secretary. Woven into the astonishing tapestry of narrative are Tutu's speeches, letters, and sermons - the thrilling addresses that have made him not only a symbol of hope for his own people but a focus for justice, peace, and reconciliation throughout the world. With a clarity of pitch born out of decades of experience, Tutu shows us all how to move forward with honesty and compassion to build a newer and more humane world. For, as he says, ""We can only be human in fellowship, in community...in Peace.""Here is a guidebook that has universal resonance, a how-to book on accomplishing a revolution, one that ends with South Africa's first free election, in which Desmond Tutu, at the age of sixty-two, is permitted to vote for the first time in his life! But here is a revolution that, as the archbishop explains, ends not in mere victory, but in peace and reconciliation for all the Rainbow People of God."

1429,"A generation removed from the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Power explosion of the 1960s, the pursuit of racial equality and social justice for African-Americans seems more elusive than ever. The realities of contemporary black America capture the nature of the crisis: life expectancy for black males is now below retirement age; median black income is less than 60 per cent that of whites; over 600,000 African-Americans are incarcerated in the US penal system; 23 per cent of all black males between the ages of eighteen and 29 are either in jail, on probation or parole, or awaiting trial. At the same time, affirmative action programs and civil rights reforms are being challenged by white conservatism.Confronted with a renascent right and the continuing burden of grotesque inequality, Manning Marable argues that the black struggle must move beyond previous strategies for social change. The politics of black nationalism, which advocates the building of separate black institutions, is an insufficient response. The politics of integration, characterized by traditional middle-class organizations like the NAACP and Urban League, seeks only representation without genuine power. Instead, a transformationist approach is required, one that can embrace the unique cultural identity of African-Americans while restructuring power and privilege in American society. Only a strategy of radical democracy can ultimately deconstruct race as a social force.Beyond Black and White brilliantly dissects the politics of race and class in the US of the 1990s. Topics include: the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill controversy; the factors behind the rise and fall of Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition: Benjamin Chavis and the conflicts within the NAAPC; and the national debate over affirmative action. Marable outlines the current debates in the black community between liberals, ‘Afrocentrists’, and the advocates of social transformation. He advances a political vision capable of drawing together minorities into a majority which can throw open the portals of power and govern in its own name."

1432,"This brilliant, explosive, and passionate book reveals the Vietnam War as we never before have seen it - through the prism of Robert McNamara's crucial and tangled decision-making. It is a book that examines not only the genesis - in McNamara's life and character - of his wartime decisions, but how they altered forever the fates of four men and a woman who, beyond their own human importance, might be said to stand in for all who were caught in the maelstrom that was Vietnam.In McNamara's looming shadow we are shown, in equally intense detail, five people who were caught up in the wake of his life-and-death decisions: an artist whose long-harbored rage erupts on a Massachusetts ferry as he tries to kill McNamara, by then retired from the Cabinet; a young Marine physically and psychologically scarred by Vietnam battle; a Quaker who immolated himself in protest outside the Pentagon; a nurse desperate to believe her agonies in Vietnam were for a good cause; and a member of a Saigon family enlisted, and then tragically abandoned, by the Americans.More than a decade in the making, The Living and the Dead is meticulously researched, astonishing in its revelations, and often in conflict with McNamara's own version of events."

1435,"More than two decades after he resigned from the presidency, Richard Nixon has lost none of his fascination. From the ongoing debates about his record in office to the contentious struggles over the White House tapes, we as a nation seem obsessed with the need to understand our most infamous political figure. In The Arrogance of Power award-winning investigative journalist Anthony Summers offers an unprecedented examination of a president whose personality embraced both political brilliance and criminal vindictiveness.Drawing on more than a thousand interviews and five years of research, Summers traces Nixon's career from his youth in California through his controversial terms in Congress and the vice presidency to his turbulent days in the Oval Office. The pattern that emerges is of a man driven by a lifelong addiction to intrigue and power, a man whose subversion of democracy during Watergate was, in fact, merely the culmination of years of cynical manipulation of the political system."

1440,"The year is 1942, and while America is reeling from the first blows of WWII, Osgood is just a nine-year-old boy living in Baltimore. As the war rages somewhere far beyond the boundaries of his hometown, he spends his days delivering newspapers, riding the trolley to the local amusement park, going to Orioles' baseball games, and goofing around with his younger sister. With a sharp eye for details, Osgood captures the texture of life in a very different era, a time before the polio vaccine and the atomic bomb. In his neighborhood of Liberty Heights, gaslights still glowed on every corner, milkmen delivered bottles of milk, and a loaf of bread cost nine cents. Osgood reminisces about his first fist-fight with a kid from the neighborhood, his childhood crush on a girl named Sue, and his relationship with his father, a traveling salesman. He also talks about his early love for radio and how he used to huddle under the covers after his parents had turned off the lights, listening to Superman, The Lone Ranger, The Shadow, and, of course, to baseball games. Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack is a gloriously funny and nostalgic slice of American life and a moving look at World War II from the perspective of a child far away from the fighting, but very conscious of the reverberations."

1449,"Storm on the Horizon is the little-known story of the key land battle of Desert Storm: the Battle for Khafji -- and how that engagement has become part of military history. Combining some of the most powerful writing on war ever with a Marine's eyeview of combat, former Marine officer David J. Morris has brilliantly recreated this crucial battle that nearly changed the outcome of the Persian Gulf War. Storm on the Horizon is war writing at its finest.On January 29, 1991, Saddam Hussein launched his three best armored divisions across the Kuwaiti border and into the Islamic Holy Land of Saudi Arabia. Their mission: to disrupt the massive U.S.-led Coalition preparing to evict them from Kuwait, and to bloody the Americans on CNN. Caught without warning in the path of this juggernaut were scattered groups of lightly armed U.S. Marines and Special Forces soldiers. Storm on the Horizon is the gripping and compelling story of how these elite fighting men escaped the Iraqi onslaught and reversed the assault with an unprecedented combination of high-tech weaponry and American know-how. This is the story of the first battle of the smart-bomb age.Storm on the Horizon drops you in the middle of the most intense battle of the Persian Gulf War. The Marines are trapped and outnumbered, their weapons no match against the Iraqi tanks bearing down on them. Their only lifeline to the rear is a barely functioning radio. Drawing upon extensive veteran interviews and previously classified reports, David J. Morris's vivid minute-by-minute narrative takes you through the battle from its beginning as a scattered collection of skirmishes to its fiery final act in the streets of the abandoned Saudi Arabian town of Khafji. Morris captures this ordeal through the eyes of the men who were there, giving readers a rare front-row seat to an incredible sequence of events. Max Morton, the pilot of a Cobra attack helicopter is forced to make an emergency landing in the heart of Khafji as the Iraqis are attacking. He and his crew narrowly escape after locating a tank of mystery fuel at a local oil refinery. Medic Kevin Callahan, member of a team of Marines caught behind enemy lines, watches helplessly as a female U.S. Army soldier and her male comrade are captured by Iraqi soldiers and spirited to Baghdad. Ronald Tull, suffering untold wounds, wakes up next to his burning light-armored vehicle thinking that it has been struck by an enemy tank round. Only later does he learn the full horror of the events that led up to the death of his seven buddies who were on board.But Storm on the Horizon is far more than a battle saga. It is a thoughtful examination of a new generation of fighting men coming to terms with its own war, a journey into the minds of men under supreme stress, and a heartfelt account of the innocence lost in a heartbeat and mourned for a lifetime.At once an unflinching chronicle of men at war and an appalling tableau, Storm on the Horizon looks into the savage heart of modern combat and raises troubling questions about the era of conflict that lies ahead."

1477,"In 1971 Richard Burke, a freshman at Georgetown University, volunteered his services to the offices of his political idol, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Through ability, hard work, and dedication, Burke rose in the next four years to become one of the Senator's closest staff members. In 1977 he was made Kennedy's personal assistant; after his appointment in 1978 as administrative assistant - the youngest in the Senate - he came to know Edward M. Kennedy perhaps more intimately than anyone outside the closed circle of the Senator's family. He was often the last to see the Senator at night and the first to see him in the morning.This book is the account of what Richard Burke witnessed and experienced during his decade at the Senator's right hand. It is neither a full biography nor an examination of Kennedy's long career in government. Rather, it is the history of a young man who shared the Senator's professional and personal lives during a time marked by exhilarating public achievements and tragic secret misconduct. His story is not only the chronicle of a shattered idol, but of Richard Burke's own fall from grace, and eventual recovery. Burke does not shrink from confronting his own faults, and he agrees with the Senator: It is time for him to confront his."

This is the story of the Army of the Potomac during that period: the initial enthusiasm dashed by sudden defeat at Bull Run; the pride at being shaped into an army by George McClellan and the frustration with his - and his successors' - inability to defeat Robert E. Lee; and, finally, the costly victory at Gettysburg, the decisive battle in which the First Minnesota played a crucial, and tragic, role. Drawing on a wide array of letters, diaries, and personal reminiscences, many of them previously unpublished, Richard Moe tells the story anew through the experiences of the men who lived it. As James MacGregor Burns notes in his foreword, ""Like Tolstoy's War and Peace, this work sticks close to the men in battle, and hence, like Tolstoy, the author keeps close to the human side of war."" In the words of Ken Burns, Moe has created ""a version of history told from the bottom up, not the top down, and we are all the richer."""

The last American diplomat to sit face-to-face with Saddam Hussein, he is a consummate insider who has the intelligence, principles, and independence to examine current American foreign policy and the inner workings of government and to form a candid assessment of the United States’ involvement in the world. In February 2002, Joseph Wilson was sent to Niger by the CIA to investigate claims that Iraq had sought to purchase uranium in that country. Wilson’s report, and two from other American officials, conclusively negated such rumors, yet all were brushed aside by the White House. Startled by the infamous words uttered by George W. Bush in his 2003 State of the Union Address: “The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa,” Wilson decided to reveal the truth behind the initiation of the Iraq war. The Politics of Truth is an explosive and revelatory book by a man who stands for the accurate recording of history against those forces bent on fabricating truth."

1494,"Black Livingstone is the first book to chronicle the remarkable life of William Henry Sheppard. As a twenty-four-year-old African American missionary in 1890, Sheppard departed for what was then the Belgian Congo, accompanied by Samuel Lapsley, a white man who had grown up on a plantation and was the son of a prominent Alabama judge. Lapsley died of fever barely a year later, but Sheppard thrived in Africa for three more years before returning to America. Back home, Sheppard was billed as the ""Black Livingstone"" as he traveled the country, lecturing to packed auditoriums. Black and white, rich and poor alike came to hear his true tales of African adventure. One year later he returned to the Congo, where he witnessed and gathered testimony on the genocide being perpetrated by the Belgian government and the rubber companies, eventually helping to break their hold on the region.  Pagan Kennedy unfolds Sheppard's life and times with a novelist's narrative skill and penetrates the complexity of her subject-a man who found power in the Congo but not in the Church to which he dedicated his life, who fought the persecution of Africans but never of blacks in his own country. Beautifully illustrated with archival photographs, Black Livingstone will appeal widely to readers of books on African history such as King Leopold's Ghost and In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz, as well as readers of fiction set in Africa, like Barbara Kingsolver's bestseller, The Poisonwood Bible."

1518,"The fabulous sequel to the bestselling, award-winning ""Lies My Teacher Told Me."" James Loewen's last book, Lies My Teacher Told Me, a debunking of the twelve leading high-school American history textbooks, won the American Book Award, the AESA Critics' Choice Award, and the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Anti-Racist Scholarship. It has sold more than a quarter-million copies in its various editions. Now, using the same irrepressibly honest approach and the same subversive take on all things bogus and misinformative, Loewen has identified a whole new arena for his one-of-a-kind inquiries into the way we tell our country's story. Lies Across America looks at more than one hundred sites where history is told on the landscape, including historical markers, monuments, outdoor museums, historic houses, forts, and ships. Loewen uses his investigation of these public versions of history, often literally written in stone, to correct historical interpretations that are profoundly wrong, to tell neglected but important stories about the American past, and, most importantly, to raise questions about what we as a nation choose to commemorate and how. Lies Across America offers startling revelations about sites we think we know: Valley Forge, Abraham Lincoln's log cabin, the Intrepid. It also tells of new sites, events, and individuals that should be commemorated on the landscape but aren't: a tombstone with a story to tell in Mississippi, a spy in the Confederate White House, the unforeseen fallout from the first nuclear missile test, the reverse underground railway, a modern ""sundown"" town (blacks can work there, but they'd better leave before the sun sets). It asks why, across our landscape, Indians are consistently ""savage,"" tribal names are wrong and derogatory, whites ""discover"" everything, and the term ""massacre"" is a one-way street; why war museums have selective memories, guides at FDR's family mansion in Hyde Park are ""specifically forbidden"" to talk about Roosevelt's mistress, and James Buchanan's house makes no mention of the fact that he was gay. It muses about the Civil War mare in Kentucky who got an extra body part, the Polynesian King made to look like a Roman emperor on monuments in Hawaii, and the statue of a conquistador in New Mexico who lost his foot. This book is a reality check for anyone who has ever sought to learn about America through our public sites and markers. It is destined to change the way we see our country. Lies Across America includes: - Sites from all fifty states plus the District of Columbia, organized geographically, west to east - Introductory essays on: the role that monuments, markers, and other historic sites play in our society; how historic markers get on the landscape in the first place; what historic markers say about the era they commemorate versus the era in which they were erected; the visual symbolism of monuments and memorials; the way historical markers are revised over time (including natural forces, spray paint, and dynamite) - A list of twenty candidates for ""toppling""--markers so distorting or inaccurate they should be removed or rewritten immediately -Forty black-and-white photos of notably interesting and/or awful markers"

1522,"Silver Wings is a thoroughly refreshing, lively, and informative history of the United States Air Force. But Walter Boyne's account is by no means history in the conventional sense. Rather than setting forth a traditional catalog of equipment, well-known campaigns, and famous pilots, Boyne chronicles the colorful inside story of the events and the men and women who shaped the Air Force into the most powerful military force in history.Boyne offers a new perspective on how the USAF grew and gradually expanded the concept of air power to that of space power. He traces the earliest days of aviation history from Civil War ballooning, through the initial establishment of the Aeronautics Division of the Signal Corps in 1907, to its rapid growth in World War I, its fight for survival during the Depression, its triumphant expansion and achievement of airpower during World War II, and its spectacular successes in recent decades.Boyne draws upon more than fifty years of research and forty years of flying experience to give depth and dimension to his story. And with a novelist's flair for storytelling, he brings to life the rogues, unsung heroes, feuds, fiascoes, and triumphs of the Air Force. Emphasis is given to the less-well-known, interesting sidelights. For example, in his account of Billy Mitchell's demonstration that airplanes could sink U.S. battleships - which stunned and infuriated American admirals - Boyne reveals the political intrigue behind the affair and its repercussions.Wonderfully informative captions accompany hundreds of photos by the premier aviation photographers and artists, as well as vintage photos from Air Force archives. Boyne uses the photos to help tell the amazing parallel story of the development of technology, from the first fragile Wright biplanes to the Northrop B-2 and the dazzling hightech Stealth fighters.Silver Wings honors the devotion of thousands of people who did their jobs without concern for recognition or reward. Anyone who served, the families of those who served, history buffs, and all proud Americans will find in this book reminders of that service - sometimes nostalgic, sometimes amusing, at other times poignant, but always fascinating."

Sometimes, though, you just have to put up with a little more crap."" --Michael J. Fox In September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease--a degenerative neurological condition. In fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. The worldwide response was staggering. Fortunately, he had accepted the diagnosis and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. Now, with the same passion, humor, and energy that Fox has invested in his dozens of performances over the last 18 years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for Parkinson's. Combining his trademark ironic sensibility and keen sense of the absurd, he recounts his life--from his childhood in a small town in western Canada to his meteoric rise in film and television which made him a worldwide celebrity. Most importantly however, he writes of the last 10 years, during which--with the unswerving support of his wife, family, and friends--he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. He is a very lucky man, indeed. The Michael J. Fox FoundationMichael J. Fox is donating the profits from his book to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which is dedicated to fast-forwarding the cure for Parkinson's disease. The Foundation will move aggressively to identify the most promising research and raise the funds to assure that a cure is found for the millions of people living with this disorder.

1546,"The statistics are familiar - young black men are being murdered in the streets by the thousands and being jailed by the tens of thousands; millions more will father children and then abandon them. While pundits and political leaders publicly wring their hands about these alarming trends, most retire at the end of the day to their comfortable suburban homes, secure in the belief that it will never happen to their children.Armstrong Williams, a nationally-syndicated radio and television host, sets a higher standard for himself. Through his shows, and in his personal life as well, Armstrong lives his own rhetoric of individual empowerment, hard work, faith, and social responsibility. This book, Beyond Blame, is the direct result of a hard-headed dialogue with a young man he calls ""Brad Howard,"" a twenty-seven-year-old drug dealer, murderer, and father of three small daughters who, in his desperation to leave the streets behind, sought Armstrong's help.Armstrong, raised on a farm and more accustomed to Washington's corridors of power than to the urban ghetto culture, must first bridge the gap between his own world and Brad's - where women are mere playthings for the amusement of pimps and hustlers, where drug money pays for Caribbean vacations or the assassination of rivals, and where individual responsibility takes a back seat to hedonism.It's not enough, Armstrong exhorts Brad, simply to ""give up"" hustling. Instead, Brad must exorcise the world-view that allowed him to fall into degradation in the first place. The ethic of entitlement and false pride, hammered into young men and women by our educational institutions, popular culture, and political leaders, is only partially to blame for Brad's plight. For in the end, it was Brad's own decisions that led to his degenerate life - quite literally, Brad's finger was on the trigger.In order to do right, Armstrong maintains, you must learn to think right. Drawing on his own unapologetic Christianity, he provides lessons in faith - a faith that will give Brad the strength to take responsibility for his actions, for the future of his children, and for his community.Beyond Blame's greatest lesson is that America's urban crime problem cannot be solved by social scientists, politicians, or platitudes. Armstrong provides a powerful reminder that each of us has the duty to get his hands dirty, to actively and aggressively take up the cause of the Brad Howards of the world - not as a social experiment, but because we are, indeed, our brother's keeper."

You choose your stringbeans one at a time. You pulp the nectarines and rape the sweet corn. You are something wonderful, you are—people of the city—and we, who are almost without exception strangers here, are as absorbed with you as you seem to be with the numbers on our hanging scales.""

1571,"In Los Angeles in 1988, a sixteen-year-old girl disappeared from her home and was later found dead of a gunshot wound to the chest. The death appeared at first to be a suicide - but some of the evidence contradicted that scenario, and detectives came to believe this was in fact a murder. Despite a by-the-book investigation, no one was ever charged.Now Detective Harry Bosch is back with the LAPD with the sole mission of closing unsolved cases, and this girl's death is the first he's given. A DNA match makes the case very much alive again, and it turns out to be anything but cold. The ripples from this death have destroyed at least two other lives, and everywhere he probes, Bosch finds hot grief, hot rage, and a bottomless well of betrayal and malice.And it's not just the girl's family and friends whose lives Bosch is stirring up afresh. With each new development, Harry Bosch finds increasing resistance from within the police force itself. Old enemies are close at hand. Even as he pushes relentlessly to find the truth, Bosch has to wonder if this assignment was intended to be his last. Digging up the past may heal old wounds - or it may expose new, searing ones."

In this gripping investigation authors Baigent and Leigh set out to discover how a small coterie of orthodox biblical scholars gained control over the Scrolls, allowing access to no outsiders and issuing a strict ""consensus"" interpretation. The authors' questions begin in Israel, then lead them to the corridors of the Vatican and into the offices of the Inquisition. With the help of independent scholars, historical research, and careful analysis of available texts, the authors reveal what was at stake for these orthodox guardians: The Scrolls present startling insights into early Christianity -- insights that challenge the Church's version of the ""facts."" More than just a dramatic exposé of the intrigues surrounding these priceless documents, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception presents nothing less than a new, highly significant perspective on Christianity."

1593,"When the marines -- or ""jarheads,"" as they call themselves -- were sent in 1990 to Saudi Arabia to fight the Iraqis, Swofford was there, with a hundred-pound pack on his shoulders and a sniper's rifle in his hands. It was one misery upon another. He lived in sand for six months, his girlfriend back home betrayed him for a scrawny hotel clerk, he was punished by boredom and fear, he considered suicide, he pulled a gun on one of his fellow marines, and he was shot at by both Iraqis and Americans. At the end of the war, Swofford hiked for miles through a landscape of incinerated Iraqi soldiers and later was nearly killed in a booby-trapped Iraqi bunker.  Swofford weaves this experience of war with vivid accounts of boot camp, reflections on the mythos of the marines, and remembrances of battles with lovers and family. As engagement with the Iraqis draws closer, he is forced to consider what it is to be an American, a soldier, a son of a soldier, and a man.  Jarhead insists we remember the Americans who are wounded or killed, the fields of smoking enemy corpses left behind, and the continuing difficulty that American soldiers have reentering civilian life.  A harrowing yet inspiring portrait of a tormented consciousness struggling for inner peace, Jarhead will elbow for room on that short shelf of American war classics."

He evokes the ambitious men who created a giant industry and shows how that industry, and our passion for the automobile, shaped the world we live in today--the world of freeways and exurbs, of shopping malls and fast-food franchises--even determining the character of whole cities like Los Angeles."

1602,"In an American story of enduring importance, Jimmy Carter re-creates his Depression-era boyhood on a Georgia farm, before the civil rights movement that changed it and the country.  In what is sure to become a classic, the bestselling author of Living Faith and Sources of Strength writes about the powerful rhythms of countryside and community in a sharecropping economy. Along the way, he offers an unforgettable portrait of his father, a brilliant farmer and strict segregationist who treated black workers with his own brand of ""separate"" respect and fairness, and his strong-willed and well-read mother, a nurse who cared for all in need -- regardless of their position in the community. Carter describes the five other people who shaped his early life, only two of them white: his eccentric relatives who sometimes caused the boy to examine his heritage with dismay; the boyhood friends with whom he hunted with slingshots and boomerangs and worked the farm, but who could not attend the same school; and the eminent black bishop who refused to come to the Carters' back door but who would stand near his Cadillac in the front yard discussing crops and politics with Jimmy's father.  Carter's clean and eloquent prose evokes a time when the cycles of life were predictable and simple and the rules were heartbreaking and complex. In his singular voice and with a novelist's gift for detail, Jimmy Carter creates a sensitive portrait of an era that shaped the nation. An Hour Before Daylight is destined to stand with other timeless works of American literature."

As we make our way together, my father—I called him Daddy when I was small, because it sounded American and that is how he so desperately wanted things to seem—is speaking in the idiosyncratic rhythms of a self-constructed English.So Sherwin Nuland introduces Meyer Nudelman, his father, a man whose presence continues to haunt Nuland to this day. Meyer Nudelman came to America from Russia at the turn of the twentieth century, when he was nineteen. Pursuing the immigrant’s dream of a better life but finding the opposite, he lived an endless round of frustration, despair, anger, and loss: overwhelmed by the premature deaths of his first son and wife; his oldest surviving son disabled by rheumatic fever in his teens; his youngest son, Sherwin, dutiful but defiant, caring for him as his life, beset by illness and fierce bitterness, wound to its unalterable end.Lost in America, Nuland’s harrowing and empathetic account of his father’s life, is equally revealing about the author himself. We see what it cost him to admit the inextricable ties between father and son and to accept the burden of his father’s legacy.In Lost in America, Sherwin Nuland has written a memoir at once timeless and universal."

1628,"Dear Reader,  When we asked the beloved award-winning comedian and actor Robert Klein to write a book, you can imagine our utter surprise when he told us that he wanted to write about sixth-century Chinese pottery. Thankfully, he hit a creative brick wall (since he doesn't really know anything about pottery from China or anywhere else). Then came similar failures to write books about sea turtles, circumnavigation of the globe, building jet engines at home, the sociology of chickens, or fungi of the skin.  Luckily, Mr. Klein's paramount concern was the consumer. He knew that if we, his publishers, were going to boldly ask you to purchase his book (see above for price), he would have to write something so good, so worthwhile, so meaningful as to make you want to send additional money to your bookseller in gratitude for having allowed you to partake in this reading experience.  So Mr. Klein set out to write about what he knows best: himself. This book is about the adventures of a child who becomes a young man: how he thinks and dreams and lusts and fears and laughs and handles adversity.    From the beginning of his distinguished career as a comedian, Robert Klein established himself as a pioneer in observational humor and razor-sharp routines that are infectiously funny. Now -- for the first time -- Klein brings his trademark humor and honesty to the printed page. In this portrait of a comic as a young man, Klein takes us back to the people and streets of his Bronx neighborhood, the eccentric cast of characters in the Catskills hotels and bungalow colonies where he worked, the college dorms where he received more than an academic education, the 1964 World's Fair where he fell in love, New York City and Chicago in the 1960s as he developed his talent, and Los Angeles just as he was about to embark on a show business career. Throughout, Klein reveals the hilarity of growing up and explores the mysteries and his own foibles in sex and relationships. He recounts with wit and poignancy losing his virginity with a prostitute, bringing home a German girlfriend to his Jewish family, and the amorous adventures of the busboy he once was.  With an ego more fragile than Chinese pottery, Robert Klein has written a funny and evocative coming-of-age memoir -- well worth the price (if we say so ourselves). Enjoy.  All the best, The Publisher"

1650,"In this book, the political writer Michael Lind, a fifth-generation native of Texas, reveals how the political tradition of one state is shaping the fate of the country and the world. Although Bush is a Republican, in his world view and his policies he is the heir of the Southern conservatives who once dominated the right wing of the Democratic Party. The economic policy of George W. Bush reflects the cheap labor, low-tax tradition of Southern farmers, ranchers and oil men, while Bush's social agenda is that of Protestant fundamentalists in Texas and similar states. Their prophecy-based beliefs about the coming end of the world influence Bush's Middle East policy, while his disdain for alliances and strategy of military unilateralism reflects the age-old military ethic of the American South. The combination of regressive economic policy, religious fundamentalism and unthinking militarism has long been familiar in Texas. Today, thanks to George W. Bush, it threatens the future of the United States - and maybe the entire world.Fortunately, George W. Bush represents only one tradition in Texas. There is another, more enlightened Texan tradition - the modernist tradition of high-tech industry and activist government represented by figures as different as Lyndon Johnson, H. Ross Perot and Admiral Bobby Ray Inman. The best antidote to Bush conservatism is made in Texas, too."

Suffice it to say that family life...is alive and well, but it is not like anything you ever read about before in your life."" -- Jane Smiley, from the foreword  The nuclear family peaked in 1960 with 45 percent of the American population. Many decades later, the tidy ensemble is rare. Relationships, baby making, sex, dating, divorce -- they aren't what they used to be. But the mainstream media keeps the reality of American life a secret, only leaking the occasional tidbit to remind us that those in ""unconventional"" configurations are a sad anomaly to be pitied or ignored.

Here are her collected stories, including two new works never before anthologized.  These stories reverberate with rural tradition, the rites of nature, and the rituals of small-town life. The country is blue-collar New England; the characters are native families and the dispossessed working class, whose heritage is challenged by the neorural bourgeoisie from the city; and the themes are as elemental as the landscape: revenge, malice, greed, passion. Told with skill and profundity and crafted by a master storyteller, these are lean, tough tales of an extraordinary place and its people."
1662,"A CLASSIC IN AMERICAN POETRY...  When Spoon River Anthology was published in 1915 it garnered immediate national attention for its truth and its shocking transgression of societal mores. A collection of poems from the graveyard of a rural Illinois town, Spoon River Anthology poignantly captures the politics, love, betrayals, alliances, hopes, and failures of this small American town. Here is the respected doctor, jailed for swindling; here is the chaste wife, rapt with desire; here is the pastor, angry and resentful; here is the quiet man, filled with unrequited love and devotion. Beneath the midwestern values of honesty, community, family, hard work, and chastity, Spoon River Anthology reveals the disillusionment and corruption in modern life.  With the publication of Spoon River Anthology Masters exploded the powerful myth that small-town America was a social utopia. Here for the first time was a community that people recognized in its wholeness and complexity. Comprised of distinctly modern poems that collectively read as a novel, Spoon River Anthology is the story of a quiet midwestern town whose truths and contradictions are celebrated by its dead."

But unlike Ruth, we have turned our backs on the Jewish people, the relatives of the Messiah.

Once again, Israel and her people are center stage at a crucial moment in world history, and this book shows why the Church must effect reconciliation and why our prayers are vital in this hour.

1681,"First Ladies tells the story of one of our nation's most curious institutions, watching the role as it has evolved from ceremonial backdrop to its current place as substantive world figure. This expanded and updated edition brings us up to the present, examining the lives and roles of our most recent First Ladies: Hillary Rodham Clinton and Laura Bush. Reaching back to our first, Martha Washington, Betty Boyd Caroli explores the background, marriage, accomplishments and failures in office of every woman who has served as First Lady--which in some cases included the daughters, daughters-in-law, and sisters of presidents.      In new and expanded entries, Caroli focuses her keen critical eye on investigate the acts, advocacies, successes, shortcomings, and legacies of Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush. Following all of her trials and triumphs, from unwelcome White House upstart to praiseworthy U.S. Senator, Caroli captures the essence of Hillary Clinton. She awards Clinton due credit for the influence she added to the position of First Lady, explores with an unflinching eye the suffering Clinton endured, and praises her as stalwart role model to women around the globe. In an entirely new entry, Caroli introduces Laura Bush as a woman of independent thought and action, a former teacher who earned a master's of library science. She shows that Bush is one who eschews political action but is nonetheless passionately committed to enriching education and boosting literacy through reading programs and literacy campaigns.      Depicting how each of the remarkable women who have served alongside our presidents have employed the ""magic wand"" given to them, Caroli reveals not only how each First Lady changed the role, but also how the role changed in response to American culture. In publicizing their accounts and stories, Caroli grants an insider's view on their lives, and also on the history of American women at large."
1682,"Set amid the elegant châteaux of Belle époque France and the closely guarded world of nineteenth-century Persian women, Courtesan unfolds with the breathtaking cinematic sweep and stunning visual grandeur of an epic film. At its heart are three unforgettable women: Madame Gabrielle, the courtesan whose fateful liaison with the shah of Persia reverberates in the lives of her daughter, Françoise, and her rebellious and brave granddaughter, Simone, whose journey plunges her into the cutthroat diamond trade, where the secrets of an ancient culture may hold the truth she desperately seeks."
1683,"John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon each dreamed of becoming the great young leader of their age. First as friends, then as bitter enemies, they were linked by a historic rivalry that changed both them and their country. In this startling dual portrait, Chris Matthews shows how the contest between the charismatic Kennedy and the talented yet haunted Nixon propelled America toward Vietnam and Watergate. Fresh, entertaining, and revealing, Kennedy and Nixon shows how the early fondness between the two men—Kennedy, for example, told a trusted friend that if he didn’t receive the Democratic nomination in 1960, he would vote for Nixon—degenerated into distrust and bitterness. Using White House tapes, this book shows how Richard Nixon’s dread of a Kennedy “restoration” in 1972 drove the dark deeds of Watergate."

1686,"The thing about race, Charles Barkley says, is we talk about it only when something bad happens and tempers are high, and so all we do is shout at one another across a chasm that's wide and getting wider. The rest of the time we try to pretend that the chasm isn't there. The way to get real about things, Barkley demonstrates in this book, isn't to shout and point fingers, but to expose all the hypocrisy and phoniness that keep us from talking about the way things really are, and even to find the humor in all the crazy disconnects and misunderstandings between the different races in America. It's time someone did, because things aren't getting better, as he's here to show us. Racism has just gone underground: Sure, celebrities like him get the white-glove treatment, but in the meantime, we're living in a country that's growing steadily more racially segregated. If you're white, what are the odds you live or work with a significant number of black people? The odds are low and getting lower. When news of the Kobe Bryant case broke, 70 percent of whites polled thought he did it; 70 percent of blacks polled thought he was innocent. What's that about?, Charles Barkley wants to know. Until we learn to see into one another's minds and hearts a little more and, crucially, to laugh with one another, we're just going to keep living the lie that racism has gone away just because it's out of plain sight.  Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man? is part rant, part personal story, and part investigation: Barkley sounds off on a wonderful range of issues relating to the subject, from interracial love to affirmative action to real estate to racial stereotypes, and he relates personal stories from his own life experience. He also goes across America to see for himself where the country is with race, talking to students in Ann Arbor about affirmative action, sitting down with the Grand Dragon of the Alabama KKK, and drawing in many other famous Americans to talk about race in their own lives and lines of work.  Frank, funny as hell, explosive-everything we feel we can't say but it really is high time we did. Only Charles Barkley, and thank heaven for him.  From the inimitable Charles Barkley, author of The New York Times bestselling I May Be Wrong But I Doubt It, comes a frank, fearless, funny, and explosive look at the reality of race and racism in America today"
1687,"Love Letters was conceived during research in the Manuscript Room of the British Library. The pleasures of handling fragile and beautiful 18th-century love letters inspired the idea of reproducing that very touching and personal experience for a wider audience. To create the book, the originals of significant love letters were tracked down and photographed in museums and libraries all over the world.How to Write Love Letters, the first-follow-up title, was published for Valentine's Day, 1996.And now the eagerly awaited third book, in the same format as Love Letters, is available.

1688,"A Stone Bridge North is the author's own story of ""miracles found and fears allayed"" in the journey out of a confining urban existence and into a simpler, more joyous life. The journey begins with Maloy's return to her Quaker faith and proceeds through a series of spiritual risks that lead her to her soul mate and her true home. To tell her story fully, Maloy must look through changed eyes at her past - at childhood anxieties, family disaffection, failed marriages, late motherhood, restless boredom, and, paradoxically, a talent for joy. She learns that she has been guided by faith even when she thought she had none. She begins to discern purpose and design both in her stories and in the light by which she sees them - a light refracted through a Quaker lens that searches for the sacred in all people. As the four seasons turn, Maloy celebrated the loves of her new life - family, friends, language, silence, and the extraordinary landscape of Vermont."

1692,"Acclaimed by the critics for her luminous first novel, Haunted Ground, Erin Hart returns with a magnificent new tale of death and destiny, past and present, in an Ireland rich with tradition, myth, and mystery.  American forensic pathologist Nora Gavin has been called to an archaeological site in the bleak midlands west of Dublin to assist at an excavation where a well-preserved Iron Age body has been found buried in a peat bog.  How many hundreds or thousands of years ago was the man killed? Was his a ritual death, some kind of human sacrifice? These academic questions are intriguing, but of much more urgent interest is the second body found nearby -- of a man wearing a wristwatch, hardly an Iron Age accessory. But his corpse does show strange similarities to that of his ancient counterpart. Both bodies bear signs of ""triple death,"" a primitive practice in which a victim was ritually slain three ways, perhaps to appease some pagan trinity.  Nora and archaeologist Cormac Maguire, embroiled in a tumultuous love affair, must team up again professionally, and are soon enmeshed in the web of tangled desires and terrible secrets that surround this untimely death. When the triple deaths continue, Nora and Cormac know they are in the middle of a deadly game.  Everyone they meet seems to have something to hide: archaeologist Ursula Downes and bog manager Owen Cadogan can barely contain their mutual antipathy; bog worker Charlie Brazil and archaeology student Rachel Briscoe are eccentric misfits with family troubles; police detective Liam Ward has never completely recovered from his wife's suicide. And watching them all from the periphery is the shadowy figure of Brona Scully, who hasn't uttered a word in the last ten years.  The danger mounts, fueled by illicit liaisons, rumors of ancient gold, and one person's thirst for vengeance. Nora and Cormac must tread carefully, for as they draw closer to the truth, they come ever nearer to becoming the next victims of a ruthless killer.  A gripping follow-up to Hart's sensational debut, weaving together history, folklore, and forensics, and following in the evocative tradition of writers such as Elizabeth George and Daphne du Maurier, Lake of Sorrows is a passionate novel of suspense from a superbly gifted new crime-writing star."

1695,"William Ewart Gladstone was, perhaps with no one other than Tennyson, Newman, Dickens, Carlyle, and Darwin, one of the stars of nineteenth-century British life.In this award-winning biography, Roy Jenkins brings Gladstone and his century vibrantly to life.Born in Liverpool in 1809, Gladstone lived until 1898, spending sixty-three of his eighty-nine years in the House of Commons. He served for twenty-seven years in the Cabinet, and was Prime Minister four times, a unique accomplishment. From his early career as a Conservative and then a Peelite, through his important role in the formation of the Liberal Party to his late preoccupation with the cause of Irish Home Rule, he was a commanding politician and became a statesman greater even than Peel and a Parliamentarian greater even than Disraeli.Gladstone has been perhaps the most complex individual ever to be Prime Minister. He was a classical scholar, a wide-ranging author, and a participant in all the great theological and liturgical debates of the day, claiming that religion was always more important to him than politics. Gladstone read over twenty thousand books and, when not suffering one of his frequent bouts of illness, walked great distances and chopped down trees for recreation. But he was also, as his seventy years of succinct diaries show, a man obsessed with terrible feelings of his own sinfulness, prone to self-flagellation and an often misunderstood practice of accosting prostitutes and attempting to persuade them of the errors of their ways."

1699,"Award-winning combat reporter Sean Naylor reveals how close American forces came to disaster in Afghanistan against Al Qaida—after easily defeating the ragtag Taliban that had sheltered the terrorist organization behind the 9/11 attacks.At dawn on March 2, 2002, over two hundred soldiers of the 101st Airborne and 10th Mountain Divisions flew into the mouth of a buzz saw in Afghanistan's Shahikot Valley. Believing the war all but over, U.S. military leaders refused to commit the extra infantry, artillery, and attack helicopters required to fight the war's biggest battle—a missed opportunity to crush hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and some of its most senior leaders.Eyewitness Naylor vividly portrays the heroism of the young, untested soldiers, the fanaticism of their ferocious enemy, the mistakes that led to a hellish mountaintop firefight, and how thirteen American commandos embodied ""Patton's three principles of war""—audacity, audacity, and audacity—by creeping unseen over frozen mountains into the heart of an enemy stronghold to prevent a U.S. military catastrophe."

But when the family business failed and his parents’ marriage fell apart, Williams discovered that his dark-skinned father, who had been passing as Italian-American, was half black. The family split up, and Greg, his younger brother, and their father moved to Muncie, Indiana, where the young boys learned the truth about their heritage. Overnight, Greg Williams became black.   In this extraordinary and powerful memoir, Williams recounts his remarkable journey along the color line and illuminates the contrasts between the black and white worlds: one of privilege, opportunity and comfort, the other of deprivation, repression, and struggle. He tells of the hostility and prejudice he encountered all too often, from both blacks and whites, and the surprising moments of encouragement and acceptance he found from each.   Life on the Color Line is a uniquely important book. It is a wonderfully inspiring testament of purpose, perseverance, and human triumph.   “Heartbreaking and uplifting… a searing book about race and prejudice in America… brims with insights that only someone who has lived on both sides of the racial divide could gain.”—Cleveland Plain Dealer"

1706,"This book is the follow-up to its immediate predecessor, The Quality School. Based on the work of W. Edwards Deming and on Dr. Glasser's own choice theory, it is written for teachers who are trying to abandon the old system of boss-managing, which is effective for less than half of all students. William Glasser, M.D., explains that only through lead-management can teachers create classrooms in which all students not only do competent work but begin to do quality work. These classrooms are the core of a quality school. The book begins by explaining that to persuade students to do quality schoolwork, teachers must first establish warm, totally noncoercive relationships with their students; teach only useful material, which means stressing skills rather than asking students to memorize information; and move from teacher evaluation to student self-evaluation. There are no generalities in this book: It provides the specifics that classroom teachers seek as they begin the move to quality schools."
1707,"David Thomson has brought a lifetime's fascination with Orson Welles and his work to this dazzling biography. Rosebud is written as a story, one that summons up the man and the artist and does justice to the genius and the fraud; the man of the world and the solitary; the spoiled kid and the sage; the infant prodigy; the chronic fabricator of his own legend; the boy who flirted with homosexuals; the ladies' man; the youth who took Broadway and radio by storm, and rocked the nation in 1938 with an airwaves fantasy of invasion; the begetter of the incomparable Citizen Kane.And here, also, is the man who famously ""failed,"" the man who made The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight. But to Thomson, those allegedly lesser films are the furnishings of another kind of masterpiece, as large and melancholy as Kane's Xanadu. Here Welles reveals himself as at once a monster of self-destruction and a triumph of self-invention.Thomson's view of Welles's ""fall"" is vital to his grasp of a profoundly complex character. We see Welles as a genius haunted by boredom and by the inability to believe in anything, as a victim of indiscipline and the helpless pleasures of talk. He is a man who attracts people, spurns them and then finds them guilty of betrayal. And so people like John Houseman, Herman Mankiewicz and Rita Hayworth, along with so many others, come and go, astonished.Rosebud traces a career of endless striving and continuous drama. At the same time, it is a book of astute film commentary that helps us appreciate Kane anew as the masterpiece of what is too often a shallow medium. It is written with an insight, a daring and a flair worthy of its remarkable protagonist."

1735,"Charles Barkley has never been shy about expressing his opinions. Michael Jordan once said that we all want to say the things that Barkley says, but we don’t dare. But even die-hard followers of the all-time NBA great, the star of TNT’s Inside the NBA and CNN’s TalkBack Live, will be astonished by just how candid and provocative he is in this book—and just how big his ambitions are. Though he addresses weighty issues with a light touch and prefers to stir people to think by making them laugh, there’s nothing Charles Barkley shies away from here—not race, not class, not big money, not scandal, not politics, not personalities, nothing. “Early on,” says Washington Post columnist and ESPN talk show host Michael Wilbon in his Introduction, “Barkley made his peace with mixing it up, and decided the consequences were very much worth it to him. And that makes him as radically different in these modern celebrity times as a 6-foot-4-inch power forward.”If there’s one thing Charles Barkley knows, it’s the crying need for honest, open discussion in this country—the more uncomfortable the subject, the more necessary the dialogue. And if the discussion leader can be as wise, irreverent, (occasionally) profane and (consistently) funny as Charles Barkley, so much the better. Many people are going to be shocked and scandalized by I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It, but many more will stand up and cheer. Like Molly Ivins or Bill O’Reilly, Charles Barkley is utterly his own thinker, and everything he says comes from deep reflection. One way or another, if more blood hasn’t reached your brain by the time you’ve finished this book, maybe you’ve been embalmed."

To do so he has to get on the good side of the bloodthirsty Judge Di, and to accomplish that he must provide the judge with a virgin maiden.

Simon's same willingness to open his heart to the reader permeates The Play Goes On.  This second act takes the reader from the mid-1970s to the present, a period in which Simon wrote some of his most popular and critically acclaimed plays, including the Brighton Beach trilogy and Lost in Yonkers, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize.

Simon's forty-plus plays make up a body of work that is a long-running memoir in its own right, yet here, in a deeper and more personal book than his first volume, Simon offers a revealing look at an artist in crisis but still able and willing to laugh at himself."

1779,"Parenting by example. Using the simple, powerful message that turned Children Learn What They Live into an international bestseller with over 1.5 million copies in print, Drs. Dorothy Law Nolte and Rachel Harris bring their unique perspective to families with adolescents. Structured, like the first book, around an inspirational poem, Teenagers Learn What They Live addresses the turbulent teenage years, when a stew of hormones, pressures, and temptations makes for such extreme challenges for parents and children. Teenagers addresses popularity and peer pressure (""If teenagers live with rejection, they learn to feel lost""); the responsibilities of maturity (""If teenagers live with too many rules, they learn how to get around them./ If teenagers live with too few rules, they learn to ignore the needs of others""); body image and the allure of cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol (""If teenagers live with healthy habits, they learn to be kind to their bodies""). Central to the book are ways for parents to communicate with their teenage children-including how to deal with being ""tuned out"" and when to start the conversation again-and how to strike the right balance between holding on and accepting a teen's growing independence. Hundreds of examples of parent-child interactions cover everything from the all-night graduation party to problems of sexual identity, providing great guidance as well as effective conversation starters."

1782,"An Innovative Blueprint for Enduring Client Relationships  More than 15 million people in this country earn their livings by serving clients, and their numbers are growing every day. Unfortunately, far too few develop the skills and strategies needed to rise to the top in a world where clients have almost unlimited access to information and expertise. Supported by more than one hundred case studies and wisdom gleaned from interviews with dozens of leading CEOs and prominent business advisors, Clients for Life identifies what clients really want and lays out the core qualities that distinguish the client advisor -- an irreplaceable resource -- from the expert for hire -- a tradable commodity.   Experts are specialists; advisors become deep generalists who have broad perspective. Experts are for hire; advisors have selfless independence, balancing client devotion with objectivity and detachment. Experts have professional credibility; advisors develop deep personal trust. Experts analyze; advisors synthesize and bring big-picture thinking to the table. Experts supply expertise and information; advisors are educators who provide insight and wisdom.   Portraits of history's most famously successful advisors, including Machiavelli, Sir Thomas More, and J. P. Morgan, underscore these timeless qualities that modern professionals need to develop to excel in today's competitive environment."

1814,"Misery Loves Maggody  And you will too.  Murder and mayhem have never been so hilarious as in the sleepy little town of Maggody, Arkansas. Population 755. And in this newest entry to the Joan Hess series, there's twice the fun when some of Maggody's most beloved inhabitants venture out of state. Meanwhile, all manner of unrest also unfolds on the familiar Maggody home front.  When beleaguered chief of police Arly Hanks hears that her mother, Ruby Bee, and best friend, Estelle Oppers, are headed for Memphis on a four-day Elvis Pilgrimage, she thinks she may be getting a break that is long overdue. But before the ""pilgrims"" are past the airport on the way out of Faberville, the fur starts flying, and soon the trip is completely stalled by a variety of deadly doings. Estelle calls home to report that Ruby Bee has collapsed and is in the local hospital, and even before Arly's seen the delta dawn, one of the other clients on the tour is found dead beneath the eighth-floor balcony of the hotel. Worse still, the balcony from which she plunged turns out to be none other than the room of a prominent Maggody citizen, who has been hauled off to the local jail. What's more, Estelle's pretty darn sure the tour van is being followed by thugs in an ominous black car -- and another body's about to be laid to rest in Graceland.  Back home things aren't much better and certainly no quieter, so Arly Hanks will have to be at her most resourceful to restore the peace once again to the inhabitants of Maggody -- both those at home and those who have roamed beyond the town limits.  Variously described by critics as a ""rollicking tour de force"" (Boston Magazine), ""Bawdy entertainment"" (Kirkus Reviews), ""Hilarious"" (St. Louis Post-Dispatch), ""delectable and continually surprising"" (The New York Times Book Review), Joan Hess's Maggody series is one of a kind and just keeps getting better."
1815,"In this ""energetic"" (Kirkus Reviews) re-creation of Anne Boleyn's tragic life -- and death -- Robin Maxwell offers a pitch-perfect version of a bawdy and exuberant time filled with lust, betrayal, love, and murder.  When the young Queen Elizabeth I is entrusted with Anne Boleyn's secret diary, she discovers a great deal about the much-maligned mother she never knew. And on learning the truth about her lascivious and despotic father, Henry VIII, she vows never to relinquish control to any man. But this avowal doesn't prevent Elizabeth from pursuing a torrid love affair with her horsemaster, Robin Dudley -- described with near-shocking candor -- as too are Anne's graphic trysts with a very persistent and lustful Henry. Blending a historian's attention to accuracy with a novelist's artful rendering, Maxwell weaves compelling descriptions of court life and devastating portraits of actual people into her naughty, page-turning tale. The result is a masterpiece of historical fiction -- so prophetic of our time that one would think it were ripped from today's headlines."

1819,"Melangell had only just marked her fifteenth birthday. In the street where she, her father, and her little sister boarded, she had been loved by all, as much for her kind heart and generous nature as for her curly black hair and slender good looks. But someone had taken advantage of that sweetness, leaving her dead in St. Mary Magdalene's churchyard, her ripped bodice testimony to her struggle, a bloodstained stone cross the solitary witness to her death.Justin de Quincy was the queen's man, working on behalf of Eleanor of Aquitaine. His duty was clear: to find her missing son, Richard Lionheart, and prevent Prince John from usurping Richard's throne. What had he to do with a commonplace murder, with the death of a poor man's child? But little by little, Justin comes to feel the force of the dead girl, perhaps even to love her as well, and he soon commits to finding her killer. But can he also bring him to justice?"
1820,"The new presidential pet shows what it's like living with the candidate, moving to the White House, and coping with his new position"
1821,"In eight Tuesdays each year, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan convenes a small committee to set the short-term interest rate that can move through the American and world economies like an electric jolt. As much as any, the committee's actions determine the economic well-being of every American. The availability of money for business or consumer loans, mortgages, job creation and overall national economic growth flows from those decisions. Perhaps the last Washington secret is how the Federal Reserve and its enigmatic chairman, Alan Greenspan, operate. In Maestro, Bob Woodward takes you inside the Fed and Greenspan's thinking. We listen to the Fed's internal debates as the American economy is pushed into a historic 10-year expansion while the world economy lurches from financial crisis to financial crisis. Greenspan plays a sometimes subtle, sometimes blunt behind-the-scenes role. He appears in Maestro up close as never before -- alternately nervous and calm, plunging into mathematics one moment and politics the next, skeptical, dispassionate, always struggling -- often alone.  Maestro traces a fascinating intellectual journey as Greenspan, an old-school anti-inflation hawk of the traditional economy, is among the first to realize the potential in the modern, high-productivity new economy -- the foundation of the current American boom. Woodward's account of the Greenspan years is a remarkable portrait of a man who has become the symbol of American economic preeminence."
1822,"A lively and provocative look at the modern culture of motherhood and at the social, economic, and political forces that shaped current ideas about parenting     What is wrong with this picture? That's the question Judith Warner asks in this national bestseller after taking a good, hard look at the world of modern parenting--at anxious women at work and at home and in bed with unhappy husbands.     When Warner had her first child, she was living in Paris, where parents routinely left their children home, with state-subsidized nannies, to join friends in the evening for dinner or to go on dates with their husbands. When she returned to the States, she was stunned by the cultural differences she found toward how people think about effective parenting--in particular, assumptions about motherhood. None of the mothers she met seemed happy; instead, they worried about the possibility of not having the perfect child, panicking as each developmental benchmark approached.     Combining close readings of mainstream magazines, TV shows, and pop culture with a thorough command of dominant ideas in recent psychological, social, and economic theory, Perfect Madness addresses our cultural assumptions, and examines the forces that have shaped them.     Working in the tradition of classics like Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique and Christopher Lasch's The Culture of Narcissism, and with an awareness of a readership that turned recent hits like The Bitch in the House and Allison Pearson's I Don't Know How She Does It into bestsellers, Warner offers a context in which to understand parenting culture and the way we live, as well as ways of imagining alternatives--actual concrete changes--that might better our lives."
1823,"Irresistibly charming, recklessly brilliant, Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald epitomized everything that was beautiful and damned about the Jazz Age. But behind the legend, there was a highly complex and competitive marriage–a union not of opposites but almost of twins who both inspired and tormented each other, and who were ultimately destroyed by their shared fantasies. Now in this frank, stylish, superbly written new book, Kendall Taylor tells the story of the Fitzgerald marriage as it has never been told before.Following the success of Fitzgerald’s first novel, This Side of Paradise, Scott and Zelda took New York by storm. Scott was recognized as the greatest American author of the twenties and everyone was fascinated with Zelda, his ravishing young wife, known as the model for all his flapper heroines. Ultimately it all fell apart, and Kendall Taylor tells us why. Drawing on previously suppressed material, including crucial medical records, Taylor sheds fresh light on Zelda’s depths and mysteries–her rich but largely unrealized artistic talents, her own ambitions that were unfulfilled because she was Mrs. F.

1841,"For three thousand years, people have sought personal insight and a window on the future from the I Ching, or the Book of Changes, the classic Chinese oracle and book of wisdom. Drawing on archeological findings, previously published only in Chinese, indicating how the I Ching was actually used by those who created it, and motivated by a lifetime of personal use and fascination, Kerson Huang has created a new translation of great significance. Restoring the I Ching to its original form, Huang underscores its first use as a practical oracle by Chinese farmers. His translation beautifully preserves the starkly poetic voice of the original, while his comments clearly and simply explain the images and detail the historical references buried within the verse. Huang reveals the I Ching as an epic poem equivalent to The Iliad and The Odyssey--one hexagram recalls the dethroning of Feng Feng; a series of lines portray Wang Hai, one of the three High Ancestors of the Shang dynasty; a third contains a sage proclamation of Lord Tang. Each hexagram and its corresponding interpretation is presented on a two-page spread, making this version unusually easy to use and understand. Introductory chapters detail the evolution of the I Ching, from the philosophical reinterpretations of Confucius to the modern musings of Carl Jung, and clearly explain both the coin method and yarrow-stalk method for consulting the oracle.

In The Roosevelt Women, Betty Boyd Caroli weaves together stories culled from a rich store of letters, memoirs, and interviews to chronicle nine extraordinary Roosevelt women across a century and a half of turbulent history.She examines the Roosevelt women as mothers, daughters, wives, and, beyond that, as world travelers, authors, campaigners, and socialites&#151;in short, as themselves. She reveals how they demonstrated the energy and intellectual curiosity that defined their famous family, as well as the roles they played in the intrigues, scandals, and accomplishments that were hallmarks of the Roosevelt clan. From the much maligned Sara Delano (who sired Franklin and by turns terrified and supported Eleanor) to Theodore&#39;s irrepressible daughter, Alice (”I can either rule the country or control Alice,” Teddy once said) to the beloved Bamie, who was the only mother Alice ever knew, and the model of everything she never was in life, to the exceptionally beautiful but ultimately overwhelmed Mittie, Theodore&#39;s mother, The Roosevelt Women is an intricate portrait of bold and talented women, a grand tale of both unbearable tragedies and triumphant achievements."

1847,"Renowned storyteller Dee Brown, author of the bestselling Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, recreates the struggles of Native Americans, settlers, and ranchers in this stunning volume that illuminates the history of the old West that’s filled with maps and vintage photographs.Beginning with the demise of the Native Americans of the Plains, Brown depicts the onrush of the burgeoning cattle trade and the waves of immigrants who ultimately “settled” the land. In the retelling of this oft-told saga, Brown has demonstrated once again his abilities as a master storyteller and an entertaining popular historian. By turns heroic, tragic, and even humorous, The American West brings to life American tragedy and triumph in the years from 1840 to the turn of the century, and a roster of characters both great and small: Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Dull Knife, Crazy Horse, Captain Jack, John H. Tunstall, Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, Wyatt Earp, the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, Wild Bill Hickok, Charles Goodnight, Oliver Loving, Buffalo Bill, and many others. The American West is about cattle and the railroads; it is about settlers who came to claim a land not originally their own and how they slowly imposed law and order on these wild and untamed places; and it is about the wanton destruction of the Native American way of life. This is epic history at its best and popular history at its most readable. This new work is culled from Dee Brown’s highly acclaimed writings, which instantly established him as one of America’s foremost Western authorities. Fully revised, rewritten, and edited into one seamless account of America’s most famous frontier, this epic narrative, along with the introduction and a chronological table of events, etches an unforgettable and poignant portrait.

1850,"Recent attacks in Oklahoma City, at the World Trade Towers, and at American embassies in Africa demonstrate the horrifying consequences of a terrorist strike. But as technological advances make weapons of mass destruction frighteningly easy to acquire, a revolution is occurring in the very nature of terrorism--one that may make these attacks look like child's play.   In The New Terrorism Walter Laqueur, one of the foremost experts on terrorism and international strategic affairs, recounts the history of terrorism and, more importantly, examines the future of terrorist activity worldwide. Laqueur traces the chilling trend away from terrorism perpetrated by groups of oppressed nationalists and radicals seeking political change to small clusters of fanatics bent on vengeance and simple destruction. Coinciding with this trend is the alarming availability of weapons of mass destruction. Chemical and biological weapons are cheap and relatively easy to make or buy. Even nuclear devices are increasingly feasible options for terrorists. And with the information age, cyber terrorism is just around the corner. Laqueur argues that as a new quasi-religious extreme right rises, with more personal and less ideological motivations than their left-wing counterparts, it is only a matter of time before the attainability of weapons of mass destruction creates a terrifying and unstable scenario.     From militant separatism in Kashmir to state-sponsored extremism in Libya and ecoterrorism in the West, The New Terrorism offers a thorough account of terrorism in all its past and current manifestations. Most importantly, it casts a sober eye to the future, when the inevitable marriage of technology and fanaticism will give us all something new to think about."

In describing life in Iran today, Christiane Bird, an American who spent part of her childhood there, breaks the silence that has surrounded Iran's culture -- unlike its politics -- for nearly twenty years.  Traveling alone and largely by bus, Bird journeys from the modern, bustling capital of Tehran to the medieval holy city of Qom, from the sacred pilgrimage site of Mashhad -- visited by more than twelve million Shi'ites annually -- to the isolated valley of Alamut, once home to the legendary cult of the Assassins. She visits mosques, public baths, Khomeini's former home, and a Caspian Sea resort, and attends prayer meetings and a horse racing meet. Along the way, she talks to muleteers and ayatollahs, Kurds and Turkomans, Westernized and traditional Iranians -- many of whom invite her home for a cup of tea.  The result is an astounding, insightful journey into the Islamic Republic of Iran -- in all its beauty, ferocity, and contradiction."

And what do they disclose about our own place in the history of life?Paleontologists Mark A. Norell, Eugene S. Gaffney, and Lowell Dingus, the curators responsible for the American Museum of Natural History's new Halls of Dinosaurs, have made these questions central to the concept and design of their spectacular reinstallation and to Discovering Dinosaurs. Drawing on their extensive experience in the field and in the laboratory, and on the incredible resources of the Museum - the world's premier collection of dinosaur fossils and information - they give us an authentic, fantasy-free understanding of these remarkable animals and their position in the great diversity of life.The authors use photographs, original drawings, maps, charts, diagrams, and historical and contemporary narratives to answer all our questions, from the most basic to the most sophisticated, about the lives and characteristics of dinosaurs; to provide a complete picture of the most important skeletons exhibited in the Halls of Dinosaurs; and to assess the genealogical relationships among these animals, and between them and later species.In words and pictures, the history of each fossil's discovery, excavation, acquisition by the Museum, and reconstruction is woven together with the story of paleontology: the unraveling, over the past 150 years, of the evolutionary record, mostly by the intrepid paleontologists who scoured remote lands in search of evidence, in historic expeditions all over the world sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History.Discovering Dinosaurs is the story of one of the greatest of all scientific enterprises, an undertaking that, as the authors describe it, transports us simultaneously to the primeval past and to the frontiers of scientific investigation today."

1877,"Sally Schneider was tired of doing what we all do—separating foods into ""good"" and ""bad,"" into those we crave but can't have and those we can eat freely but don't especially want—so she created A New Way To Cook.Her book is nothing short of revolutionary, a redefinition of healthy eating, where no food is taboo, where the pleasure principle is essential to well-being, where the concept of self-denial just doesn't exist.More than 600 lavishly illustrated recipes result in marvelous, vividly flavored foods. You'll find quintessential American favorites that taste every bit as good as the traditional ""full-tilt"" versions: macaroni and cheese, rosemary buttermilk biscuits, chocolate malted pudding. You'll find Italian polentas, risottos, focaccias, and pastas, all reinvented without the loss of a single drop of deliciousness. Asian flavors shine through in cold sesame noodles; mussels with lemongrass, ginger, and chiles; and curry-crusted shrimp. Even French food is no longer on the forbidden list, with country-style pâtés and cassoulet.Hundreds of techniques, radical in their ultimate simplicty, make all the difference in the world: using chestnut puree in place of cream, butter, and pork fat in a duck liver mousse; extending the richness of flavored oils by boiling them with a little broth to dress starchy beans and grains; casserole-roasting baby back ribs to render them of fat, then lacquering them with a pungent maple glaze.Scores of flavor catalysts—quickly made sauces, rubs, marinades, essences, and vinaigrettes—add instant hits of flavor with little effort. Leek broth dresses pasta; chive oil becomes an instant sauce for broiled salmon; a smoky tea essence imparts a sweet, grilled flavor to steak; balsamic vinegar turns into a luscious dessert sauce. Variations and improvisations offer infiinite flexibility. Once you learn a basic recipe, it's simple to devise your own version for any part of the meal. ""Fried"" artichockes with crispy garlic and sage can be an hors d-oeuvre topped with shaved cheeses, part of a composed salad, or as a main course when tossed iwth pasta. It's equally happy on top of pizza or stirred into risotto. And by building dishes from simple elements, turning out complex meals doesn't have to be a complex affair.A wealth of tips and practical information to make you a more accomplished and self-confident cook: how to rescue ordinary olive oil to give it more flavor, how to make soups creamy without cream, how to freshen less-than-perfect fish.So here it is, 756 glorious pages of all the deliciousness and joy that food is meant to convey."

1886,"Teaching Your Children About God is a book that reaches out to those who yearn to offer their children something more than the mere material, who know that a good life and a good person derive as much from the growth of the spirit as from the world's more tangible gifts.Because many of today's parents were raised with no formal religious training, they know little of the texts and rituals. Sensing their own neediness yet wanting to nurture their children's spirituality, they search their hearts and memories only to come up empty-handed. Now, for all these parents, Rabbi Wolpe offers a pathway into the tradition. In clear and welcoming language, he explains the important themes in Judaism and shows the many ways the religion can be passed on.

As Muslim and Jew battled for control, the Christians were caught in the crossfire: endangered and largely forgotten, victims of somebody else's war. In The Body and the Blood, Charles M. Sennott examines the dwindling Christian communities of the modern Middle East in search of answers to the following questions: Why is Christianity dying out in the land where it began? And what are the consequences, not only for the future of Christianity but for the Middle East itself? From Israel to Lebanon to Egypt to Jordan to the ancient cities of the West Bank, Sennott finds that the themes resonating today are the same as those that convulsed the region at the time of Christ. His frontline reporting is powerful and provocative, as he shines a new light on the Middle East."

1898,"A sassy and exuberant debut novel, Ruby River chronicles the courage and compromises of a newly widowed mother in a small Southern town in a masterful examination of family, marriage, and community.Warm, sensuous, and hailed as ?a triumph” by The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ruby River drops us into a small town during a blistering Alabama summer where Hattie Bohannon has just opened a truck stop. A magnet for transients of questionable background and inclination, and run by Hattie’s nubile daughters, the truck stop is an uneasy presence in Maridoches, where the population prides itself on their fixed family values and staunch, principled lifestyle. Crackling with the energy and spark of strong, colorful characters whose lives are continually colliding, Ruby River gathers heat and tension until it culminates in a conflagration of ideologies that is as poignant as it is comical, and as heartbreaking as it is hopeful.A widow whose husband’s ashes have been lost by the Veteran’s Association, Hattie exists in a limbo of unexpressed grief, trying to determine the contours of her self alone. At the same time, she must contend with the burgeoning sexuality of her strong-willed daughters, who are trying to forge their own place within their now fatherless family, and in the community at large. In a season of unrelenting heat, when caterpillar pods have infested all the trees, desire gestates and hovers over Maridoches, threatening the moral equilibrium of the small church town. When Hattie’s oldest daughter, Jessamine, is falsely accused of prostitution, the Reverend conveniently declares war against the immorality of the Bohannons and their establishment, and what ensues is a clash of wills and values that will leave no one unaffected.Among the quirky residents of Maridoches are Sheriff Dodd, who pursues the ambivalent Hattie’s affections, and then causes strife when his affections find another object in Jessamine; Reverend Peterson, whose magnetic wife?once his brilliant muse?is now the source of his chief frustration; Gert Guerin, a cook at the truck stop who believes it is her calling to save the souls of all those around her.Lynn Pruett deftly interweaves the struggles of Hattie, her daughters, and the surrounding community to create a tapestry of individuals desperately trying to deny the conflicting urges of flesh and spirit, progress and tradition. And flowing through the narrative, as well as the town of Maridoches itself, is the Ruby River, offering liberation for those seeking relief from the oppressive summer heat and their hawk-eyed neighbors, and inspiring irrational, overwhelming terror in those who despise what cannot be contained by neat boundaries. In the tradition of beloved contemporary writers such as Fannie Flagg and Rebecca Wells, Lynn Pruett’s glorious tale?rich with the earthy wit and flavor of the south?captures the struggle for the very soul of a community suddenly forced to look at itself in a new light."
1899,"Adhocracy: Any form of organization that cuts across normal bureaucratic lines to capture opportunities, solve problems, and get results.In an era of accelerating change, organizations, and national economies, most likely to succeed are those with the ability to adjust and adapt. Robert H. Waterman Jr., coauthor of the best-selling In Search of Excellence, shows how and what this sort of innovation must become a way of life for business organizations across the board. What is needed is an environment that fosters the use of an ad-hoc problem-solving technique, in effect an ""adhocracy"" that functions outside the often initiative-stifling bureaucracy.Drawing on twenty-five years' experience in management consulting, Waterman offers clear instructions on how to establish adhocracy and make it work: creating task forces and independent business units, even two people meeting in a hallway to solve a common problem. A lively and insightful work, this should become an essential handbook for managers at all levels who recognize the need to redefine the rules for success."

1903,"Exit Life as You Came in It: Penniless!And Other Heretical Hints For Living Well In The New Economic Age""If you don't read this book, you're going to die stupid!""-- Dr. Laura Schlessinger The Baby Boomers are a generation of achievers:  They earned college and professional degrees and are scampering up the corporate ladder or starting entrepreneurial enterprises that boost their egos and their bank accounts.  They buy sensible ""starter homes"" and plan to parley them into impressive dream houses through smart real estate deals, all the while deftly juggling their home, family and business lives.  If two incomes don't cover all life's necessities -- and necessary luxuries -- their credit cards serve as readily available genies to make wishes reality.  If their ultimate rewards have always been clear -- an early and comfortable retirement and a healthy estate to leave for the children -- why are they now facing the future with fear and trepidation?In Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan   (HarperBusiness; November 1997; $25.00), financial advisers Stephen M. Pollan and Mark Levine explain the economic realities that have rendered the old rules obsolete and offer an innovative approach to financial planning that focuses on getting the maximum use out of your income and your assets during your  lifetime and renouncing the foolish (and futile) quest for financial immortality.  From the startling recommendation, ""quit now,"" to the heretical ""die broke,"" Pollan lays out the details of a complete financial revolution.""Viewing yourself and your work as one,"" Pollan writes, ""is a tremendous financial and emotional risk."" To prove that the ""Self-Fulfillment Ethic"" and the false belief in careers must give way to a new work ethic, Pollan cites a ready role model -- the professional athlete.  Free agents in the sports world know their tenure with any team is temporary and concentrate on getting the best financial deal they can.  Adopting their attitude is the key for anyone who doesn't want to remain on the sidelines in the next century.  Pollan advises that work is not a holistic pursuit.  The only  way to increase satisfaction and/or income is to job hop with a constant eye toward a work setting that will increase skills (and therefore marketability) and improve quality of life with immediate advantages like premium health insurance, company day care, parental leave and telecommuting and flex time options.  ""Long term benefits, like pension plans,"" Pollan reminds readers, ""are worthless.  Most of you will be fired long before you are fully vested.""  What else is keeping people locked in the 20th century?  Two little pieces of plastic:  ATM cards and credit cards.  The convenience is irresistible; the costs are mind-boggling.  Offering a strong dose of reality, Pollan insists that spending should be difficult and uncomfortable:  ""You must resolve to no longer reach beyond your grasp.  If you don't have the cash on hand or in your checking account to buy something... don't buy it.""Pollan issues an equally important warning about the biggest purchase most people make in their lives -- real estate.  Home-ownership remains an excellent tax shelter and a desirable form of enforced savings that can help generate income in later years.  But with the unpredictability of the real estate market, the benefits of ""serial ownership,"" or ""trading up,"" have become less likely.  Pollan's solution is to save your money until you can ""buy your second home first,"" by purchasing a residence that is large enough to accommodate a growing family, aging parents and even a home business -- in short, a home designed for a lifetime.  Along with demanding a new perspective on work, credit and real estate, the new economic age lays to rest the American ""dream"" of retirement.  Not only are traditional sources of retirement money (government assistance and private pensions) drying up, but people have discovered that long-term leisure isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Pollan encourages readers to shift their viewpoint and think about earned income the way they've always thought about unearned income: It may grow, stagnate or decrease.  Investing and savings should be used to generate unearned income that will supplement on-going but fluctuating earnings.  Among his recommendations: Keep a liquid reserve (in Certificates of Deposit, for example), pile up tax free savings by taking full advantage of IRAs, Keoghs, SEPs or 401(k)s, stick with equity investments like stock mutual funds far longer than traditionalists recommend, insure your income with top-notch health and disability coverage and protect your family with term life insurance that gives them enough to get by so they can adjust to the loss of your income.  There's one last obstacle to living well now and in the future: the obsession with inheritance.  Like retirement, the desire to establish an estate is a hold-over from an earlier age and leads to unnecessary sacrifices that far outweigh any future benefits.  Asserting that ""every dollar that's left in your bank account after you die is a dollar wasted,""  Pollan outlines a plan that enables you to die broke while guaranteeing that you don't out-live your assets.  His plan includes what kind of annuities to invest in for a maximum flow of income, the best ways to share your money with loved ones while you're still alive, how to get paid for living in your house and the ins-and-outs of Medicaid, Medigap, long-term care  insurance and other vehicles for covering expenses at the end of life1s journey.   Recognizing that accepting a theory is one thing and putting it into practice another, Pollan provides an invaluable examination of 63 different career and financial topics from the Die Broke  perspective.  Throughout the book, Pollan specifies the optimum times to pursue various financial options, but stresses that it is possible to go back and accomplish most objectives before moving on to the next phase or to hold off on a step until you meet the criteria he discusses.  The good news is it's never too early and never too late to live well and DIE BROKE."

And now, lonely and frustrated, the weary voyagers have returned to a homeworld unrecognizably altered by the relentless tides of time - a world that does not want them back.A bitter welcome awaits the Searchers, as old Libary gathers Earth's Ordinands and Elders together to tap the terrifying power of the collective unconscious - in preparation of the Carnival night when they will sweep the helpless intruders back to their lonely sky in the name of Holy Science.

If it sometimes feels as if this country is having a collective anxiety attack, then you won’t be surprised to learn that more than 19 million Americans suffer from some form of acute anxiety.Poe’s Heart and the Mountain Climber tackles this situation head-on, with a fresh perspective and a straightforward approach to exploring and understanding our anxiety before it paralyzes us.After interviewing many experts on anxiety, and reflecting on his own many years treating anxious patients (as well as experiencing more than a few anxious moments himself), Dr. Richard Restak has organized this book around one primary principal: the best way to manage anxiety in these anxious times is to learn about it and put that learning to practical use. His message is vital and empowering: anxiety is not a mental illness that must require medication, but often a normal, biological response to stress.Anxiety is part of our genetic makeup. We wouldn’t be alive today if our ancestors had lacked the ability to anticipate dangers and threats. Anxiety is as natural a part of our existence as breathing, eating, or sleeping, and it is closely linked to our powers of reasoning. Unlike any other species, only we are able to envision future possibilities. As a result, we aren’t tethered to the here and now, but can imaginatively anticipate the good things that might happen to us. But we can also envision the bad things and, as a result, experience anxiety. We can’t have one without the other. Anxiety, therefore, isn’t something to be eliminated but, rather, something to be understood. Anxiety is only undesirable when it becomes extreme.This groundbreaking book teaches us to view anxiety not as a burden, but as a stimulus for greater accomplishment and enhanced self-knowledge. We will function at our best when we stop working to deny our anxiety or trying to escape it and instead learn to accept its presence in our lives and transform it into the positive, creative energy from which it stems."
1988,"Andrew M. Greeley, one of the most renowned authors and lecturers of our day, here turns his attention to a variety of the trials and frustrations that we all too often encounter in these hectic, pressure-filled times. These essays on nearly fifty themes address our fears, hang-ups, and worries, providing commonsense advice, consolation, and encouragement. In his inimitable fashion, Greeley blends the wisdom of the Scriptures with his own down-to-earth and uplifting insights. Anyone involved in the frequently harried and painful business of living—indeed, everyone—will find their true solace for those moments when life hurts. “I can heartily endorse this wo . . . Greeley deals not only with sorrow, but offers truly comforting reflections of other troubled moments, for our frustration, our physical and mental pain, for our hopelessness and despair.”—Morton Kelsey"
1989,"There are some things people think but don't say....  ""Political correctness is the classic Great Idea Gone Wrong. All it's done is shut us up. It hasn't changed anybody's mind. It hasn't changed our hearts. It's changed our faces. It's taken every opinion we have, it's taken every joke we have, and it's forced us to conceal it and hide it and bury it. It's made us superficial.""  ""Terrorism isn't caused by poverty, poverty is caused by terrorism. Terror is a tool used by those seeking power to keep the masses in need of an answer.""  ""Too many people blame everything on everybody else, and because they do, they will expect too little from themselves and too little from their children."" Glenn Beck says all that, and more.  As one of the most listened to nationally syndicated radio talk-show hosts and the driving force behind the Rallies for America, Glenn Beck entertains, inspires, and informs millions of listeners. In The Real America, Beck continues to tell it like it really is, cutting through the fog of modern-day pundits and pontificators who have made it their mission to undermine and underestimate the greatness of America, our strength as Americans, and the power of the American spirit.  With his inimitable combination of self-effacing humor and heartfelt conviction, Glenn rails against many of the forces that keep us from our potential as a nation and as individuals -- and tells how to overcome them. His topics include:   Family and community  Politics  Personal responsibility  Race relations  Religion  Political correctness, the media, Hollywood, and celebrities  Abortion and the deat penalty  Alcohol and drugs  Why I wave the flag  Glenn Beck's compelling message in The Real America echoes the ideas he has delivered to thousands of people with his groundbreaking Rallies for America: Once we connect with our power individually, we can empower others -- and then we can be as great and as grand as we have always wanted to be as a person, as a people, and as a nation."

1992,"Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet’s Uncle Vanya is a sparkling restoration of a masterpiece of the modern stage, marked by Mamet’s finely tuned ear for dialogue and memorable poetic imagery.In ""Uncle Vanya,"" a retired professor and his beautiful young wife return to the country estate left by his deceased first wife to find themselves overwhelmed by the stagnant inevitability of the rituals of their life and class, and mercilessly taxed by the encroachment of age at the expense of youth. All of the play’s characters are plunged into that precarious state where, in Beckett’s words, &#147;the boredom of living is replaced by the suffering of being.”Working from a literal translation by Vlada Chernomordik, Mamet, who has also adapted Chekhov’s Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard, opens the way for a contemporary audience to establish immediate contact with a classic, infusing the power of Chekhov’s play with the potent precision of his own modern voice."
1993,"Artfully imagined, intricately detailed, eerily poignant: these are the outstanding features of Carol Goodman’s literary thrillers. She is part novelist, part craftsman—and The Drowning Tree is her newest masterpiece.Juno McKay intended to avoid the nearby campus of her alma mater during her fifteenth reunion weekend, but she just can’t turn down the chance to see her longtime friend, Christine Webb, speak at the Penrose College library. Though Juno cringes at the inevitable talk of the pregnancy that kept her from graduating, and of her husband, Neil Buchwald, who ended up in a mental hospital only two years after their wedding, Juno endures the gossip for her friend’s sake. Christine’s lecture sends shockwaves through the rapt crowd when she reveals little-known details about the lives of two sisters, Eugenie and Clare—members of the powerful and influential family whose name the college bears. Christine’s revelation throws shadows of betrayal, lust, and insanity onto the family’s distinguished facade.But after the lecture, Christine seems distant, uneasy, and sad. The next day, she disappears. Juno immediately suspects a connection to her friend’s shocking speech. Although painfully reminded of her own experience with Neil’s mental illness, Juno nevertheless peels away the layers of secrets and madness that surround the Penrose dynasty. She fears that Christine discovered something damning about them, perhaps even something worth killing for. And Juno is determined to find it—for herself, for her friend, and for her long-lost husband.From the Hardcover edition."

1996,"Working as an emergency room nurse, Margaret Coberly came in contact with death on a daily basis. However, it wasn't until her own brother was diagnosed with terminal cancer that she realized she understood very little about the emotional and spiritual aspects of caring for the terminally ill. To fill this gap she turned to the unique wisdom on death and dying found in Tibetan Buddhism. In this book Coberly offers sound, practical advice on meeting the essential needs of the dying, integrating stories from her long career in nursing with useful insights from the Tibetan Buddhist teachings. In the West, death is viewed as a tragic and horrible event. Coberly shows us how this view generates fear and denial, which harm the dying by adding unnecessary loneliness, confusion, and mental anguish to the dying process. Tibetan Buddhism focuses on the nature of death and how to face it with honesty, openness, and courage. In this view, death is not a failure, but a natural part of life that, if properly understood and appreciated, can offer the dying and their loved ones an opportunity to gain valuable insight and wisdom. Coberly argues that the Tibetan Buddhist outlook can be a useful antidote to the culture of fear and denial that surrounds death in the West and can help caregivers become more fully present, fearless, honest, and compassionate. Sacred Passage  highlights two very practical teachings on death and dying from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and presents them in clear, nontechnical language. Readers learn about the ""eight stages of dissolution leading to death,"" a detailed roadmap of the dying process that describes the sequence of physical, psychological, and spiritual changes that occur as we die. Coberly also presents the ""death meditation,"" a contemplative exercise for developing a new relationship to death—and life. The book also includes a lengthy, annotated list of recommended readings for added guidance and inspiration. Topics include:   How the terminally ill can experience emotional and spiritual healing even when they can't be cured  Why Western medicine's relentless focus on curing disease has led to inadequate care for the dying  What to expect during the dying process  How our fear and denial of death harm the dying  Techniques to help caregivers promote a peaceful environment for the dying and their loved ones  How to meet the changing physical and emotional needs of the dying  Helpful advice on what to say and how to behave around the terminally ill"

2006,"Nowhere else in the world can compare with the incredible array of domestic architecture in America. It sometimes seems that there are as many styles of houses as there are actual number of houses. While the earliest American houses were largely derived from English or Dutch prototypes, the diversity for which America is so celebrated soon emerged, reflecting mostly how Americans used their homes, as well as local and regional tastes and vernacular and folk origins from around the world. The variety and dynamism in the style of homes in that emerging pluralistic society marches on today in homes designed by adventuresome architects and clients.In this extraordinary celebration of the American house, renowned author David Larkin, with commentary by some of today's leading architectural historians and critics, examines the paths that have led to distinctively American homes. Special attention is given to examining details of the makeup of each house as well as the functions of ""the home"" and how these functions have changed just as technology, social relations, and living arrangements have changed in the United States over the past 400 years.Filled with more than 400 beautiful color photographs, this book also contains six double gatefolds, which offer dramatic presentations of the elements and details that make up the variety of architectural styles in American residential architecture. No other illustrated history of the American house can come close to this full portrayal of the historical and stylistic ranges of the place we call ""home."""

2019,"On September 11, 2001, FDNY Battalion Chief Richard ""Pitch"" Picciotto answered the call heard around the world. In minutes he was at Ground Zero of the worst terrorist attack on American soil, as the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center began to burn-and then to buckle. A veteran of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, Picciotto was eerily familiar with the inside of the North Tower. And it was there that he concentrated his rescue efforts. It was in its smoky stairwells where he heard and felt the South Tower collapse. Where he made the call for firemen and rescue workers to evacuate, while he stayed behind with a skeleton team of men to help evacuate a group of disabled and infirm civilians. And it was in the rubble of the North Tower where Picciotto found himself buried-for more than four hours after the building's collapse.  This is the harrowing true story of a true American hero, a man who thought nothing of himself-and gave nearly everything for others during one of New York City's-and the country's-darkest hours."

2025,"For the first time ever, Sex in America reveals the myth-shattering results of the only comprehensive and methodologically sound survey of America's sexual practices and beliefs.In 1992, highly regarded social scientists Robert T. Michael, John H. Gagnon, and Edward O. Laumann embarked on an unprecedented study of America's sex life. Working through the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, their staff of 220 interviewers spent seven months interviewing 3,432 scientifically selected respondents about all aspects of their sex lives, histories, and beliefs. More important, unlike the famous but inherently flawed reports of Alfred Kinsey, Redbook and Playboy magazines, Shere Hite, Samuel and Cynthia Janus, and others, this survey relied on a random sample of Americans rather than on an unrepresentative group of volunteers. The resulting data reveal not just what we do sexually but how society shapes even our most private sexual experiences. They show not just why we are the way we are, but what it might take to change this behavior.Sure to arouse considerable controversy, the survey directly contradicts many of the conclusions of previous reports and defies widely held conventional wisdom about America's sexual practices and beliefs, with startling revelations about how often people have sex, how many partners they have, and where they meet them; the likelihood that the AIDS epidemic will spread into the heterosexual population; what people like to do in bed; how many Americans are homosexual; the incidence of forced sex; and why some people are more satisfied with their sex lives than others.After years of misleading statistics and unsubstantiated claims, Sex in America presents a comprehensive, reliable look at America's collective sex life, the definitive word on American sexuality today."

2027,"Fact: The Christian Coalition's 1994 voter guides appear to have been skewed to favor Republican candidates in key congressional races across the country, in direct contravention of federal election law.The truth is, the politicians couldn't be happier dickering over the remains of the welfare state. Because, as you'll learn in Dirty Little Secrets, there is probably not a politician in America who does not benefit directly, personally, and continually from the status quo.Fact: On the eve of the 1994 elections, mock ""pollsters"" called up thousands of voters in one Wisconsin congressional district to ask whether their electoral decisions would be influenced if they knew one of the candidates was a lesbian.Most politicians want to do the right thing. But they also want to be reelected, and the system is far stronger than any honest man or woman. The influence of money and the intricacies of the levers of power make it easier for politicians to ignore the law than to obey it. In Dirty Little Secrets you will read of the conservative movement's hidden manipulations in 1994, and learn the truth about Newt Gingrich's twenty-year program of political destabilization. The history of the corrupt House the Democrats built with the help of liberal interest groups stands revealed. And Larry J. Sabato and Glenn R. Simpson expose the corrupt and illegal tactics both parties have used for decades to protect and promote their own power.Fact: In 1994, in Alabama, one local election was decided by fewer than three hundred votes. Seventeen hundred ballots cast in that election were illegally admitted absentee ballots, some of them submitted by dead people.Sabato and Simpson's fresh reporting and thousands of hours of background research include interviews with influential politicians, consultants, and political operatives, Freedom of Information Act requests, and thousands of pages of obscure campaign reports. They prove corruption is not about bad apples or colorful local traditions. And they offer a completely original plan for reform - Deregulation Plus - that will frighten both parties and make the American electorate smile for the first time in years. Dirty Little Secrets pulls together the corruption story from all parts of the country so overwhelmingly that no one - from the White House to your house - will be able to deny that political reform must be one of the key issues of the 1996 election campaign."
2028,"This book is a wide-ranging and general introduction to Islamic civilisation from its origins to the present day. Writing in clear and non-technical language, Professor Savory's contributors seek answers to broad and important questions: how did a single civilisation develop in a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural region; how did Islamic internationalism come to be translated into powerful nationalist movements in modern times; how has the West been affected by its continuing contact with Islam; what factors have threatened Islamic civilisation in modern times, and is there a future for it at all. The book begins with a section on the geographical, ethnic and linguistic background of the Middle East, continues with an historical résumé of the Islamic period, and moves on to the core chapters on the religious, philosophical and legal foundations of Islamic society and its contributions to world civilisation in the fields of literature, art, science and medicine. The time-scale covers the pre-Islamic, medieval and modern periods, and care has been taken to draw out the implications of the interaction between Christian West and Islamic East from the Crusades down to the massive encroachment of the West upon the Muslim world - at military, political, economic and cultural levels - in the modern era. Introduction to Islamic Civilisation is based on a successful series of adult-education programmes broadcast on Canadian radio, organised by members of the Department of Islamic Studies at the University of Toronto. The material has been revised and rewritten for book publication and is offered as a genuinely introductory handbook on a vital and fascinating subject."

Which five of each important composer's works should you buy? What is a concerto and how does it differ from a sonata?Maybe you don't know the answers to these questions; author Phil Goulding certainly didn't.

Comprehensive, discriminating, and delightfully irreverent, Classical Music provides such essential information as:* Rankings of the top 50 composers (Bach is #1. Borodin is #50) * A detailed and anecdotal look at each composer's life and work * The five primary works of each composer and specific recommended CDs for each. * Further great works of each composer--if you really like him * Concise explanations of musical terminology, forms, and periods * A guide to the parts and history of the symphony orchestra ""This book uses every conceivable gimmick to immerse readers in the richness of classical music: lists, rankings, sidebars devoted to lively anecdotes, and catchy leads.""--The Washington Post""One terrific music appreciation book...The information is surprisingly detailed but concisely presented.

2068,"A debut novel of startling originality that follows a young girl's passionate and eccentric quest for invincibility, courage, trust, and love.Leslie Marshall's first novel is a startling, fresh, totally captivating new voice. With Elray Mayhew, she has created perhaps one of literature's more unforgettable young heroines. Elray Mayhew loses her parents on her sixth birthday at an amusement park going through the Tunnel of Love. The boat the three of them are in is leaking and Barkely and Jack's feet are on the wet floor so that when the electrical moon falls from the ceiling and into their laps, they are electrocuted. Elray survives intact except for a crescent shaped scar on her right underarm. In following years she can touch the scar and communicate with them, receiving instructions, or offbeat and amusing comments, in their distinctive voices.Elray, orphaned, is now in the custody of two uncles, brothers each of Barkley and Jack. Harwood is a macho, heavily-drinking photographer who travels about the world on assignments. Aunt Ajax, as he prefers to be called, is a cross-dressing gay man who gives up his fringe existence in New York to come to Washington, move into Barkley and Jack's old house in the Cleveland Park, and throw himself full throttle into motherhood, albeit, at times, a misguided version of it.Elray doesn't speak for days and spends most of her time hiding in a crawlspace under the house. During a gathering after her parent's funeral she's there, listening to everyone shuffle above her and hearing them call her name, when she lets out her second massive scream. It's her voice returning, her Aunt Ajax, one of her new official guardians, runs to check on her. Following her is her Uncle Harwood, official guardian #2. The three of them, camped out under the house, decide to mark the day as Crawlspace Day. Crawlspace Day will be celebrated annually to mark the day that their lives became entwined, and she'll receive, belatedly, her cake and her gifts, all under the house.By the time she's twelve, Elray is spending all her time creating adventures and going on solo explorations. One day, creeping through the crypts of the Washington Cathedral that is near Half-Moon Street, she comes eye to eye with Raoul Person, a boy just her age as awkward, precocious, and alone as she is. Their story is the beating heart of this novel. They connect immediately, and together they form a partnership to practice ""the art of invincibility""-something they'd both been trying to conquer-and christen themselves The Invincible Heels. He's her fellow knight and from crafting amateur black and white movies, to imitating their actual deaths in makeshift coffins, to a harrowing midnight swim across the Potomac when Elray just escapes drowning, they challenge each other to confront their fears.Although they remain close, as they move into the period termed ""The Vertical Bog""-Elray's wry code for puberty-they drift apart. Her interest in filmmaking deepens, and Raoul begins running after the girly-girls. Elray withdraws, mourns Raoul, and hears less and less from her parents when she touches her scar-she's growing up. She still feels like a failure after their harrowing crossing of the Potomac, combined with typical low self-esteem of her age group, she decides to master her largest fear-going back to Glen Echo and riding again through the Tunnel of Love. Harwood accompanies her, and afterwards, she finally feels like a young adult.And happening all at the same time, Elray's paternal grandmother-long thought dead-resurfaces and sues for custody of her granddaughter (she claims to have faked her death in a fire at Blackie's House of Beef to free her family from her destructive drinking and gambling ways). Elray, at this fragile stage in her life, delights in the weirdness of the situation and welcomes the elegant, grand, smoking and dancing old woman, while unwittingly betraying her family by dis"

2070,"""Real"" federalism, Michael S. Greve argues, is a federalism that promotes citizen choice and competition among the states. Far from being an anachronism in an increasingly complex society, a regime that permits citizens to choose among competing jurisdictions - each offering a different mixture of government services - is uniquely suited to a country of highly mobile and increasingly sophisticated citizen-consumers.Real Federalism provides a road map for reviving citizen choice and state competition. Greve shows how the Supreme Court, which has reestablished at least some federalism constraints, and a loose coalition of ""leave-us-alone"" constituencies - including some religious groups, home school and school choice organizations, and term limit and tax limit advocates - can through a ""virtuous cycle"" of progressive accommodation and cooperation succeed in advancing federalism."
2071,"Hoopes's first work of fiction is a historical novel featuring James M. Cain, later the master of ""hard-boiled"" mystery novels, and H. L. Mencken, the famous iconoclastic journalist, as amateur detectives. Two Baltimore reporters (friends at that time and later in real life), they are investigating the deaths and sex scandals in the Harding administration in 1923, just before the big Teapot Dome scandal breaks.There is a remarkable relevance of 1920s scandals to today's political environment, but that remains behind the book as Mencken and Cain, two bright literary men playing Holmes and Watson, take the train to D.C. to get the real scoop. They drink a lot, meet a mysterious, sexy redhead named Roxy (a real-life influence on Cain) and a rogue named Gaston B. Means, and get a lot more than they bargained for. With hard-boiled enthusiasm they expose some of the roots of the corruption infecting our capital. All the speaking roles are real historical characters."
2072,"After fifty years as observer and participant on the front lines of the civil rights movement, Harry Ashmore finds the nation still unable, or unwilling, to face up to the basic issues posed in Gunnar Myrdal's classic An American Dilemma. In this memoir, Ashmore takes up where Myrdal left off in 1944, giving us a retrospective view of the causes and effects of the post-World War II civil rights movement, considering it in the context of the political developments that both advanced and hindered its effectiveness.As executive editor of the Arkansas Gazette, Ashmore led the fight against Governor Orval Faubus when he closed Little Rock's Central High School in defiance of the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. As the protest by blacks spread across the nation, Ashmore was present at the heart of the action as journalist, academic, foundation executive, and adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. He has won Pulitzer Prizes for himself and his newspaper and has produced a body of work that makes up a unique chronicle of a turbulent era.Civil Rights and Wrongs is a powerful and important reappraisal of the American Dilemma by a man who has viewed it from the eye of the storm it has spawned."
2073,"Like the Joads of Steinbeck's unforgettable The Grapes of Wrath, Oca Tatham and his family trekked west with the millions of Americans who fled the Great Depression in search of jobs and hope in California. Rising in the West presents the magnificent story of what became of this family, and opens a fascinating, heretofore almost unchronicled chapter of American experience.Drawing on years of intensive historical research, as well as countless interviews with family, friends, and associates, Dan Morgan gives us the Tathams' remarkable lives in absorbing detail. In less than half a century, they went from migrant fruit-picking to middle-class prosperity in the promised land of California, where they got caught up in the quintessential realities of the Sun Belt: agribusiness, irrigation projects, the defense industry, real-estate development, nursing home chains, and football franchises. But like so many white Southerners who went west coming from nothing, the Tathams remained outsiders. As individualistic Christians ever wary of mainstream American life and skeptical of mainstream notions of success, they found their place in that cohesive Sun Belt culture whose religious, ethical, and political outlook would form the basis of the New Populism that manifested itself so dramatically in the Reagan Revolution.More than anything else, fundamentalist Pentecostalism is at the heart of the Tathams' experience. The brush arbors and storefront churches of Oca's youth are linked by generations of deep religious commitment to the huge revivalist tabernacles that dot southern California. While the family has always been bound together by the fervor of their faith, Morgan shows how that faith is being tested today, not only as the Tathams confront inevitable family adversities like alcoholism, terminal illness, and troubled marriages, but also as they, and others like them, take their stand on the deeply divisive issues - including abortion and school prayer - topping the national agenda, and leave their profound stamp on American politics.Rising in the West is an extraordinary achievement - an engrossing account of the growth of America, as well as the intensely personal drama of a family struggling to keep faith with itself."

There, a cop killing solved years before has reverberated through the lives of the three black children who witnessed it, one the son of the man convicted of the murder.Fifteen years later the long-dead case comes back to life, exploding in the media with a bang. A ruthless politician has decided to get the minority vote by claiming the police coerced the children into pointing a finger at Charles Conklin, an innocent man. Conklin's son, deprived of a father's guidance, has ended up in Juvenile Hall charged with a murder of his own. It is a situation sure to ignite sparks of protest in a tinderbox city - and bring Mike Flint's career down in flames.With her dreams newly joined to Mike's, Maggie begins her own campaign to clear his name, and the gutsy, prize-winning filmmaker is taking her camera and sleuthing skills into the heart of an embattled city.

2090,"From Anne Bradstreet's The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America in the seventeenth century, to Toni Morrison's Nobel Prize in 1993, women writers have woven a rich tapestry of voices across four centuries of American history. Their writings have embraced a marvelous diversity of visions, including those of Emily Dickinson, Gertrude Stein, Cynthia Ozick, Gwendolyn Brooks, Kate Chopin, Maya Angelou, Annie Dillard, Joan Didion, Edith Wharton, Adrienne Rich, Djuna Barnes, and Willa Cather.The Oxford Companion to Women's Writing in the United States provides a comprehensive, authoritative, and highly informative survey of these writers and their work as it illuminates the issues that fired their imaginations.Here is a goldmine of information about women's writing, women's history, and women's concerns--over eight hundred entries, ranging from brief identifications to extensive essays. The volume boasts contributions by many well-known thinkers, including Susan Faludi writing on backlash, Deborah Tannen on communications between the sexes, Jane Gallop on Lacanian psychoanalysis, Nell Irvin Painter on Sojourner Truth, and Trudier Harris on Toni Morrison. There are nearly four hundred biographical entries, touching on not only important poets, novelists, and playwrights (including such modern figures as Wendy Wasserstein, Anne Tyler, Alice Walker, and Tama Janowitz), but also women writers who have made important contributions in other fields, such as Betty Friedan, Rachel Carson, Margaret Mead, Aimee Semple McPherson, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony. Perhaps most important, there is extensive coverage of the many personal, cultural, and historical issues that have been explored by and have influenced the lives and productivity of women writers, including AIDS, race and racism, violence and sexual harassment, the Civil War, the civil rights movement, and much more. There is also coverage of the publishing world (including bookstores and women's presses), the art and practice of writing, and contemporary literary criticism (including lesbian literary theory, black feminism, and deconstruction).The women who have written beautifully, poignantly, tenderly, humorously, or powerfully about America and American lives are indeed a heterogeneous group.The Oxford Companion to Women's Writing in the United States captures this remarkable diversity, painting a fascinating portrait of women and women's writing in America."
2091,"Eddy Arnold was just a sweet-voiced, third-generation cotton farmer from Western Tennessee with a dream: to lift himself out of rural poverty and make a name for himself as a country performer. This book traces the history of the Arnold family to a Confederate soldier named Robert M. Arnold, who began farming cotton in the Henderson region after the war. His son, Will, wed twice; his second wife, Georgia, gave birth to Richard Edward Arnold in 1918.After the stock market crash, Will Arnold lost ownership of his farm, and young Ed was less than happy working as a tenant farmer for absentee owners. An avid amateur guitarist, he soon had paying jobs at dances and gatherings around the area; inspired to go further afield, he traveled up the road to Jackson, Tennessee, where he garnered his first radio job. Meanwhile, he worked daytimes for an undertaker to help make ends meet.Forming a duo with fiddler Howard ""Speedy"" McNatt, they moved from station to station, in search of the elusive perfect homebase. They got as far as St. Louis, where their local popularity blossomed. A chance audition with radio cowboy star Pee Wee King led the duo to join King's successful band, and even greater fame for the smooth-voiced Tennessee songster. With King's band, Eddy honed his professional chops, was introduced to a wide audience via Nashville's ""Grand Ole Opry"" radio program, and met the legendary and flamboyant manager Colonel Tom Parker, who would greatly influence his career.Breaking away as a solo act, Eddy signed with Victor Records toward the end of World War II, and formed his first, highly influential band, featuring fiddler McNatt, ""Little"" Roy Wiggins on steel guitar, and bassist Gabe Tucker. His first hits were sentimental ballads, and by the late '40s he was one of Victor's top-selling artists and a consistent concert draw. His popularity was so great that he became a welcome figure on national radio and television in the mid-'50s.Then, a new sound shook the airwaves: Rock and roll. The market for Eddy's smooth country style diminished, and Eddy faced some lean times. Determined to crossover into the mainstream pop market, he experimented with a variety of styles until, in the early '60s, he hit on a perfect blend of country sentiments with uptown accompaniments. The result was a string of mid-'60s hits, highlighted by the classic ""Make the World Go Away."" Eddy Arnold was a star all over again - and this time on the mainstream stage."

Finally, Dr. Matthews helps readers explore the connection between faith and medicine in their own lives through methods of prayer, community worship, and study of Scripture."

Anniston has some very particular requests for his landlord, and try as he might, Charles cannot avoid being lured into Bennet's strange world. At first he resists, but soon he is tempted - tempted by the opportunity to understand the secret ways of white folks. Tempted to understand a set of codes that has always eluded him. Charles's summer with a man in his basement turns into an exploration of inconceivable worlds of power and manipulation, and unimagined realms of humanity."
2098,"The glorious, turbulent sixteenth century is drawing to a close. Elizabeth, Queen of England, has taken on the mighty Spanish Armada and, in a stunning sea battle, vanquished it.But her troubles are far from over. At home she is challenged at every turn by the brilliant but reckless Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, whose dangerous mix of passion and political ambition drives the aging queen to distraction. Just across the western channel, her colony Ireland is embroiled in seething rebellion, the island's fierceuntamed clan chieftains and their ""wild Irish"" followers refusing to bow to their English oppressors.In the midst of the conflict is Grace O'Malley, notorious pirate, gunrunner, and ""Mother of the Irish Rebellion."" For years, the audacious Grace has plotted and fought against the English stranglehold on her beloved country. At the height of the uprising Grace takes an outrageous risk, sailing up the River Thames to London for a face-to-face showdown with her nemesis, the Queen of England.The historic meeting of these two female titans --perfectly matched in guts, guile, and political genius -- sets the stage for the telling of the little-known but crucial saga of Elizabeth's Irish war, a conflict at the very root of every subsequent Irish uprising. No one breathes life into these strong and pugnacious women as does Robin Maxwell in this captivating novel, a rousing tale that makes historygloriously real."

2108,"Can the welfare system  in the United States accord  people dignity? That question is often left out of the current debates  over welfare and workfare. In this provocative book, Nancy Rose argues  that the United States has been successful in the past––notably during  the New Deal and in the 1970s––at shaping programs that gave people  “fair work.”            However, as Rose documents, those innovative  job creation programs were voluntary and were mainly directed at  putting men back to work. Women on welfare, and especially women of  color,  continue to be forced into a very different kind of program:  mandatory, punitive, and demeaning. Such workfare programs are set up  for failure. They rarely train women for jobs with futures, they ignore  the needs of the women’s families, and they do not pay an honest wage.  They perpetuate poverty rather than prevent it.           Rose  uses the history of U.S. job creation programs to show alternatives to  mandatory workfare. Any effort to redesign welfare in America needs to  pay close attention to the lessons drawn from this perceptive analysis  of the history of women, welfare, and work. This is an indispensable  book for students, scholars, policymakers, politicians, and  activists––for everyone who knows the system is broken and wants to fix  it."

2119,"1. The opening chapter of Roadrunner reveals Dell's state of despair. He relies on a cocktail of prescription drugs to take him to a zone where there are 'no paparazzi, no reporters, no questions he couldn't answer.' Do you get the impression that the bulk of these unanswerable questions come from the press, or from his family? Who is he trying to escape from? Is your first reaction to Dell pity or revulsion? Does that reaction change at any point in the story? 2. Just before their violent incident, Leah offers Dell a choice between his family and his misery. Do you think she is right to lay it all on the line at this point? How far should a spouse go to help his/her partner recover from an addiction or a debilitating depression? Does your answer change when you factor children into the equation? Why or why not? 3. Dell fantasizes about his pre-injury athletic prowess: 'Crouched in stance, anticipating the speed and shape of the ball . . . the crack of the bat . . . the run!' But he also dwells on his golden reputation: 'the high unmatched by any other, fans, superiority, and recognition.' Is he addicted to the game of baseball, or simply to fame? Do you think the cult of personality that the professional sports world engenders is necessarily corrupting? Or does it serve a useful purpose in providing kids with recognizable heroes? 4. As the squad car pulls up to her house, Leah recognizes that a severe shift in balance has just occurred between 'what her life really was and what she thought it ought to be.' Weeks later, as she fends off one of Angel's stronger advances, she laments that 'This wasn't supposed to be her life . . . This wasn't supposed to be happening.' Where else in the novel do we see the theme of shattered expectations and thwarted 'supposed to's? Which characters are able to adapt to the disappointments of reality, and which are destroyed by them? 5. What influence has Leah's mother had on her in terms of relationships? What influence has Angel's mother had on him? What do you think Josh learns from Leah in the course of the story? 6. Dell makes a show of thanking God for his successes in front of the media, but privately considers himself his own god, fully responsible for all his own actions. 'His days and nights had been filled with strategy, with maintaining control of his destination.' In what ways is Angel similar? Do you think Angel truly feels for Leah all that he professes, or is his obsession with her all about him? Given Angel's background, what does the wife of a professional athlete symbolize to him? 7. Does Angel's tragic family situation cause you to sympathize with him? Why do you think he's unable to go through with the dire crimes he contemplates, Squire's murder and Dell's murder among them? Is he a coward? 8. In what ways does Roadrunner address the theme of addiction? What is Leah addicted to? Angel? Elicia? Does anyone make a full recovery by the end of the novel? 9. Angel's behavior with Kayla seems to seal the deal that he's a creep. Does he overstep his bounds before this? At what point do you lose trust in Angel? Would Leah be justified in filing a sexual harassment charge against him? Why does she never consider doing so? 10. Dell often hides in his son's room because Leah 'rarely came down the hall past the point where organization and structure became disheveled, where mess and clutter lurked behind every closed door . . . She simply asked that the children's doors be kept closed so what she didn't know wouldn't hurt her.' Is this Leah's key problem—that she can't process life's messiness? If so, does Dell recognize it as a problem? 11. Right before Dell decides to piece together the puzzle of who and where he is, he awakens from an exhausting baseball dream to the realization that 'he was merely a man, nothing more.' Do you read this as a final defeat for Dell, or as a positive turning point? 12. Angel is profoundly affected by the discovery that his childhood idol has devolved into a drug-addled wife-beater. How much of his treatment of Dell is motivated by anger at having his own bubble burst? Does he pursue Leah because he has a newfound sense of his own potential, or because he wants to prove a point about men like Dell wasting their precious gifts? 13. Since money is no object in the Fletcher household, are you surprised that Leah fails to hire detectives to hunt for Dell? Is her judgment impaired by her own ambivalent feelings about her marriage, and her growing weakness toward Angel's advances? Or is she simply so used to Dell making the household decisions that she's paralyzed without him? What course of action would you take in her shoes? 14. As Leah contemplates the events that have led her and Dell to their predicament, she recalls him not as an equal partner, but as an 'opponent,' forging ahead rapidly toward his goals, while she is left 'trailing behind like a quiet breeze.' How much of her behavior toward him is motivated by jealousy and/or resentment that he pursued his dream while she raised the kids? What could they have done to ensure more equality in the marriage?"

2123,"The topic of retirement becomes increasingly compelling as the U.S. population ages. It's easy to find books about how to plan financially for those years after careers end, but Breaking the Watch focuses on the many ways of creating a life, not just making a living, as a retired person.This book follows women and men from a rural American community as they approach and experience the first years of retirement. Joel Savishinsky focuses on the efforts people make to find meaning in a stage of life American culture often views in a confused or disdainful way.In conversations and stories, 13 men and 13 women demonstrate a deep commitment to defining their own retirement. They bring to their mature years a diversity of backgrounds, interests, and responsibilities. They include former teachers, librarians, doctors, farmers, lawyers, bankers, mail carriers, and secretaries. Some are married, others divorced or single; many have children and grandchildren, but some have neither. Their finances run the gamut from the modest to the munificent, while their health ranges from robust to disabled. From an examination of the ""rites of passage"" that marked their exit from full-time work, Breaking the Watch moves on to consider how to plan appropriately for retirement; renegotiate ties to friends, family, and community; and create a sense of passion—be it for t'ai chi, travel, painting, or politics—that will drive a new sense of purpose. These intimate glimpses into real lives allow a rare understanding of the retirement process."

What she finds is that winning her cases no longer triggers the satisfaction and excitement it once did.

2147,"""Essays of considerable literary erudition and sophistication that... dislodge dull stereotypes to enable both women and men readers to see the Bible with fresh eyes.""--Los Angeles Times Book ReviewAs the one work that has held moral and religious sway over the Judeo-Christian tradition for thousands of years, the Bible is unsurpassed in world literature. For women, its meaning is particularly complex; traditionally, the Bible has been used to keep women in their place, but it has also been a book of enduring inspiration. Out of the Garden marks a new stage in women's relations to the Bible: this is the first collection of essays in which women read and respond to the Bible out of pleasure and curiosity--free to explore what is really relevant to women's lives.Drawing on their own experiences and interests, Louise Erdrich, Cynthia Ozick, Fay Weldon, Phyllis Trible, Rebecca Goldstein, June Jordan, Ursula K. Le Guin, and twenty-one other writers boldly, imaginatively--and sometimes reproachfully--address the Old Testament stories, characters, and poetry that mean the most to them. Thoughtful, challenging, and playful, these beautifully written essays explore the Bible in fresh new ways. Out of the Garden reclaims the Bible for women and shows readers that the Bible is a source we can return to again and again.""A many-splendored achievement...This grand collection is a bold revitalization of our relation to our tradition. It offers the reader the gorgeously varied company of strongly delineated temperaments as they take on the compelling, threatening figures of our imaginative forebears.""--Harold Bloom Author of The Book of J and The Western Canon"

2151,"A decomposed body is found high in the mountains of central Colorado. The remains are identified as those of Nicole Marie Caswell, age twenty-two. Ten months later Jason Smiley is arrested and charged with Nicole Caswell's rape and murder.Long before Smiley's arrest, Cinda Hayes had become disillusioned working as chief sex-crimes prosecutor for the Boulder County District Attorney's Office - a job muddled by too many calculating egos, too much machismo, and not enough decency. When the opportunity arises for her to become director of the Boulder County Rape Crisis Center, she doesn't think twice - she jumps at the chance to leave the practice of law behind.But six months after Jason Smiley is convicted and sentenced to death, Cinda is abruptly summoned by her old mentor, Justice Hilton James of the Colorado Supreme Court, and told that the state has chosen her to handle Smiley's appeal. The appointment creates obvious conflicts for Cinda - her new profession is built on defending rape victims - but Justice James assures her that she will not be expected to argue her client's innocence. She is instructed, instead, to scrutinize the trial record for errors that may have compromised Smiley's right to procedural justice.Cinda's strenuous efforts to avoid being drawn deeper into Smiley's case are failing, as Smiley insists that the only error at his trial was the conviction of an innocent man. At a memorial service for a fallen Boulder mountain climber, Cinda begins to sense the truth, which may include a deep cover-up involving Tory and the D.A.'s office. Armed with what she has learned, Cinda must decide whether to defy the court's instructions and demand to have a high-profile death-row case reopened."

2169,"Famous for such Broadway hits as Jesus Christ Superstar, Cats, and Phantom of the Opera, Andrew Lloyd Webber has now transformed the classic Hollywood film Sunset Boulevard into a stunning theatrical experience. From the movie's portrayal of obsession in Hollywood and its atmosphere of romance, decadence, and cynicism, Lloyd Webber has created a haunting score and one of the greatest musicals of all time. This lavishly illustrated, definitive account traces the origins of the film and tells the fascinating story of the making of Lloyd Webber's latest masterpiece.Directed by Billy Wilder, the film Sunset Boulevard first appeared in 1950 with Oscar-nominee Gloria Swanson in the most memorable role of her career. As Norma Desmond, the great star of the silent screen, she attempted to use a failed young screenwriter, played by William Holden, as the means to make her return to the movies. Among the hundreds of films set in Los Angeles that used the silver screen as a mirror for Hollywood culture, Sunset Boulevard is recognized as one of the finest and has had an extraordinary influence on Hollywood cinema and film noir.As an introduction to Wilder's film, author George Perry looks at the famous street, Sunset Boulevard, and the history of silent movies. He describes the creation of the film and its significance in the chronology of American cinema and includes a recent interview with the director, archival photographs, and film memorabilia.For the remarkable musical staging of Sunset Boulevard, Andrew Lloyd Webber amassed a wealth of artistic talent - from director Trevor Nunn, stage designer John Napier, and costume designer Anthony Powell, to a magnificent cast headed by Patti LuPone and Kevin Anderson. Through interviews with all the principals, George Perry sheds light on the show's complex production machinery and pays tribute to the creativity of the many people who have contributed to its extraordinary success.

2174,"In Portrait of Picasso as a Young Man, Mailer sets out to capture the meaning of Picasso's life and art and explores in bold fashion the originality of his ambition. Commenting upon much of the critical work on Picasso that has appeared over the years, Mailer's biography brings us closer to the young artist than we have ever been before. Much at the heart of Mailer's interpretation is Picasso's first great love, Fernande Olivier, with whom the artist lived for seven years - a period that included Picasso's most revolutionary works, from the explosive innovations of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon to the mysteries of Cubism itself. To understand Picasso in these years, Mailer argues, it is necessary to follow his relationship with the extraordinary Fernande, who is here given her own voice by way of excerpts from her candid memoirs, hitherto unpublished in English. Since this period also includes Picasso's friendships with Apollinaire and Gertrude Stein, the book evokes the charm and special character of bohemian life in Paris in the early 1900s.Closely integrated throughout the text are more than 250 illustrations, including black-and-white and color reproductions of Picasso's works (drawings, sketches, and major paintings), as well as pertinent photographs and contributory works by other artists."

All mankind is seeking the answer to the confusion, the moral sickness, the spiritual emptiness that oppresses the world. All humanity is crying out for guidance, for comfort . . .for peace.Dr. Graham shares God’s gentle, reassuring promise of spiritual calm—of authentic personal peace—amidst a personal life wracked with too much stress, too many burdens, too great a heartache.“I know men who would write a check for a million dollars if they could find peace,” writes Dr. Graham. “Millions are searching for it. But we Christians have found it! It is ours now and forever. We have found the secret of life! . . .When your spouse dies or your children get sick or you lose your job, you can have a peace that you don’t understand. You may have tears at a graveside, but you can have an abiding peace, a quietness.“God’s peace can be in your heart—right now . . .Whatever the circumstances, whatever the call, whatever the duty, whatever the price, whatever the sacrifice—His strength will be your strength in your hour of need. “It’s all yours, and it’s free. You don’t have to work for it . . . . Do not put it off.”"

What a worthy performance, he thinks, murdering a man while a million people watch.The other is Kathleen Mallory.

But even she cannot predict the spectacular chain of events that has already been set in motion, or the profoundly disturbing consequences it will have for those she holds most dear. For misdirection is the heart of magic. The lady never really gets sawed in half, does she?So why is there so much blood?"
2209,"Elizabeth Benedict's last novel, The Beginner's Book of Dreams, was hailed by Anne Tyler as ""a wonderful book ... complex, fascinating ... a joy to read"" (Chicago Tribune). Her new novel, Safe Conduct, is a harrowing exploration of trust and deception between men and women in the midst of the Cold War and at the heart of a marriage.Filmmaker Kate Lurie and her new husband, Eli MacKenzie, stop in Brussels, en route to Istanbul to finish making a movie, when out of Mac's past comes Lida, a stunning, determined Russian woman with whom he had an illicit affair while a diplomat in Leningrad fifteen years earlier. Lida's surprise appearance following the collapse of the Soviet empire, her shocking revelations about her relationship with Mac, and her brazen pursuit of him force Kate to confront the truth about her marriage, herself, and her husband's lost son.Kate narrates the story with a filmmaker's sharp eye and the intriguing sensibility of a cool headed, strong-willed woman whose confidence is slowly unraveled by Lida's familiarity and her husband's increasing distance. An exquisitely choreographed novel about first passion and missing children, about the complex burdens of love, lust, and memory, Safe Conduct confirms Elizabeth Benedict's reputation as a brilliant portraitist of broken families and ""an enormously talented writer"" (Philadelphia Inquirer)."
2210,"?On Tuesday morning, a piece was torn out of our world. A patch of blue sky that should not have been there opened up in the New York skyline?. Our city was changed forever. Our country was changed forever. Our world was changed forever.” So wrote Jonathan Schell in the first issue of The Nation magazine following September 11, 2001. In A Just Response, some of the most respected figures on the progressive left analyze the causes and consequences of this new American wound in a series of thoughtful, informed, and provocative essays. Selected from The Nation and other sources, these articles counter the bombast and jingoism of so much of the media coverage since September 11?while providing informed analysis, provocative commentary, and reasoned debates. The writers in these pages speak out against ?Fascism with an Islamic face,” jingoism, and the undermining of civil rights, address the confusion between dissent and treason, and articulate a vision of a just response to terrorism. Others reflect on an interview with Osama bin Laden, the concept of ?Blowback”?modern technological society turned unwittingly against itself?and the American right wing’s exploitation of a national emergency to further its political agenda. Also included are dispatches from other countries around the world, brief background histories of bin Laden’s origins, the roots of fundamentalism, asymmetrical warfare, and a heated exchange between Noam Chomsky and Christopher Hitchens."

2223,"T.C. Boyle has proven himself to be a master storyteller who can do just about anything. But even his most ardent admirers may be caught off guard by his ninth novel, for Boyle has delivered something completely unexpected: a serious and richly rewarding character study that is his most accomplished and deeply satisfying work to date.  It is 1970, and a down-at-the-heels California commune has decided to relocate to the last frontier-the unforgiving landscape of interior Alaska-in the ultimate expression of going back to the land. The novel opposes two groups of characters: Sess Harder, his wife Pamela, and other young Alaskans who are already homesteading in the wilderness and the brothers and sisters of Drop City, who, despite their devotion to peace, free love, and the simple life, find their commune riven by tensions. As these two communities collide, their alliances shift and unexpected friendships and dangerous enmities are born as everyone struggles with the bare essentials of life: love, nourishment, and a roof over one's head.  Drop City is not a satire or a nostalgic look at the sixties, though its evocation of the period is presented with a truth and clarity that no book on that era has achieved. This is a surprising book, a rich, allusive, and nonsentimental look at the ideals of a generation and their impact on today's radically transformed world. Above all, it is a novel infused with the lyricism and take-no-prisoners storytelling for which T.C. Boyle is justly famous."

She woke to air that was dry and cold around her. She was no longer Agnes, or even Karonhisake, Searching Sky. She was no longer American or Haudenosaunee. She was English, and her name was Mary, and she woke to find that she was dying, freezing to death.It came to Agnes unbidden - a vision of Mary Newbury, alone in the snow, dying of the cold. A vision of a young woman who had lived in the 1600s, who had been driven from her Puritan settlement, accused of being a witch. It was an image of a woman whose life was about to change radically as she embarked on an existence that defied all accepted norms - embracing passionate independence, love, and loyalty to a proud, endangered community that accepted her as one of their own. Mary’s and Agnes’s lives have been separated by almost 400 years, but they are inextricably linked by more than blood. For, like Mary, Agnes has special powers - and Mary now seeks these powers to ensure that the rest of her story is told."

2241,"Kakuzo Okakura, who was known in America as a scholar, art critic, and Curator of Chinese and Japanese Art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, directed almost his entire adult life toward the preservation and reawakening of the Japanese national heritage — in art, ethics, social customs, and other areas of life — in the face of the Westernizing influences that were revolutionizing Japan around the turn of the century.This modern classic is essentially an apology for Eastern traditions and feelings to the Western world — not in passionate, oversentimental terms, but with a charm and underlying toughness which clearly indicate some of the enduring differences between the Eastern and Western mind. Okakura exhibits the distinctive ""personality"" of the East through the philosophy of Teaism and the ancient Japanese tea ceremony. This ceremony is particularly revelatory of a conservative strain in Japanese culture; its ideals of aesthetic tranquility and submission to the ways of the past find no parallel in the major cultural motifs of the West.Not only does he discuss the tea ceremony and its rigid formalities, and the cult and patterns of belief surrounding tea and tea-drinking, but Okakura also considers religious influences, origins, and history, and goes into the importance of flowers and floral arrangements in Japanese life — their proper appreciation and cultivation, great tea-masters of the past, the tea-room with its air of serenity and purity, and the aesthetic and quasi-religious values pervading all these activities and attitudes.Okakura's English style was graceful, yet exceptionally clear and precise, and this book is one of the most delightful essay-volumes to the English language. It has introduced hundreds of thousands of American readers to Japanese thinking and traditions. This new, corrected edition, complete with an illuminating preliminary essay on Okakura's life and work, will provide an engrossing account for anyone interested in the current and central themes of Oriental life."

2244,"Are today’s teenagers really slackers, the apathetic, baggy-pants wearing, unmotivated individuals so often portrayed by the media? This engrossing account?based on a landmark study of 7,000 teens?gives us good news and bad news about our teenagers. Contrary to prevailing notions, theirs is the most ambitious generation yet. But because schools and parents do a poor job of directing them, many take the wrong courses, choose the wrong colleges, and often finish college with neither job skills nor specific career goals. Their dreams of success are likely to remain just that?dreams.Barbara Schneider and David Stevenson reveal that today’s teens are not only misdirected but often very alienated. They spend more time alone and are depressed about it. Fewer teens have best friends or solid romantic relationships. And at school they move from group to group, changing affiliations often. Schneider and Stevenson show how parents and teachers can take adolescents’ admirable raw ambition and provide them with direction and social support that they so sorely lack. As the authors demonstrate through many poignant cases, it is not enough to simply tell teens to work hard. We must also help them to figure out what they want to do and how to go about doing it."

2246,"James Watson, a discoverer of the structure of DNA, described it as ""the most golden of molecules,"" the true chemical for life. Indeed, it is the essential component from which our genes are made. In it is encoded the genetic language that controls our destinies. Astonishingly powerful, just six millionths of a gram of DNA carries as much information as ten volumes of theOxford English Dictionary. The ""Book of Man,"" is the term used by Walter Bodmer and Robin McKie for the DNA that is the instruction set according to which all humans are made. At conception, a single cell--the fertilized egg--is produced, and it is this one cell that has the potential to form a new and unique individual under the guidance of the DNA within its nucleus. The human body is made up of a hundred million million cells of many different sorts, and all contain the inherited information that comes from that first, single cell created at fertilization. Bodmer and McKie assert that when we learn how to read DNA's pages and chapters we will obtain the information relevant to the understanding of most diseases, individual differences in behavior, and a new awareness of our own history and evolution. The Book of Man explores how genetic information is now being read and interpreted by focusing on biology's most ambitious undertaking to date--the Human Genome Project, an attempt to uncover all the 100,000 genes that control our development and detail the DNA alphabet of each. The authors go on to wrestle with the moral and ethical issues of modern genetics, making a case for a rational appraisal of genetic engineering and for the public to become sufficiently ""DNA literate"" in order to appreciate the crucial role it plays in our lives. From Gregor Mendel's discovery of the laws of inheritance to the high-tech, crime-stopping power of forensics science and the fascinating but sometimes troublesome implications of the latest science of genetic engineering,The Book of Man brilliantly explores and explains the quest that is changing our understanding of what it means to be a human being."

2251,"""Surprisingly tender."" -- The New York Times Book Review. Set in Kabul under the rule of the Taliban, this extraordinary novel takes readers into the lives of two couples: Mohsen, who comes from a family of wealthy shopkeepers whom the Taliban has destroyed; Zunaira, his wife, exceedingly beautiful, who was once a brilliant teacher and is now no longer allowed to leave her home without an escort or covering her face.

Stepping Up to Power looks backward in order to move women forward; Woods believes that getting more women to enter the political arena will take both their commitment and a knowledge of the past. The author uses her own life story to recall how women excluded from public life were fired by their determination to solve local problems and by their passion for social issues. Decade by decade, from the 1950s to the present, Woods candidly discusses the positive and negative aspects of pivotal events leading to a triumphant moment when women believe they finally have broken through to real political power-only to discover that new challenges remain.The author examines some of the myths about women as voters and candidates; tells stories about such colorful figures as Bella Abzug and Betty Friedan; provides step-by-step advice on becoming a candidate; and describes from her own personal experience such moments as the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings, the 1992 ”Year of the Woman,” the appointments of Janet Reno and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and her own breakthrough race for the U.S. Senate in Missouri in 1982.Stepping Up to Power will fascinate general readers as well as students of women&#39;s history. America has been transformed by a revolution that has changed the personal and public relationships between men and women. The question remains: How will women use the power they have gained? Stepping Up to Power provides an inspiring answer."

As a crusading reporter, he chased snake-oil peddlers, rip-off artists, and corporate thieves, winning the applause of his peers. But along the way, he noticed that there was something far more troublesome going on: While the networks screamed about the dangers of exploding BIC lighters and coffeepots, worse risks were ignored. And while reporters were teaming up with lawyers and legislators to stick it to big business, they seldom reported the ways the free market made life better.In Give Me a Break, Stossel explains how ambitious bureaucrats, intellectually lazy reporters, and greedy lawyers make your life worse even as they claim to protect your interests. Taking on such sacred cows as the FDA, the War on Drugs, and scaremongering environmental activists -- and backing up his trademark irreverence with careful reasoning and research -- he shows how the problems that government tries and fails to fix can be solved better by the extraordinary power of the free market.He traces his journey from cub reporter to 20/20 co-anchor, revealing his battles to get his ideas to the public, his struggle to overcome stuttering, and his eventual realization that, for years, much of his reporting missed the point.Stossel concludes the book with a provocative blueprint for change: a simple plan in the spirit of the Founding Fathers to ensure that America remains a place ""where free minds -- and free markets -- make good things happen."""

2319,"The dreadful global conflagration known as the Second World War was more than the clashing of great armies on bloody battlefields. A different kind of war was being waged in the secret laboratories on both sides of the conflict -- a war that would alter the course and determine the outcome of the bitter hostilities, forever changing our world and future.In a stunning amalgam of science and history, Tom Shachtman, the critically acclaimed author of Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold and The Phony War, 1939-1940, gives us a riveting chronicle of World War II's forgotten combatants: the engineers, physicists, chemists, and academics whose contributions to the war effort were as important as the noble sacrifices of the soldiers, sailors, and airmen who bravely risked their lives.While it is a widely accepted fact that America's development and employment of the atomic bomb ended the Pacific struggle -- and that the failure of Hitler's scientists to develop their own A-bomb helped to doom Germany -- little note has been made of the other remarkable scientific accomplishments of this dark and terrible epoch. Beginning with a fascinating overview of the Depression-era struggle to establish scientific and military alliances that would ultimately enable the Allies to catch up to the Axis's early dominance, Terrors and Marvels offers an eye-opening history of the furious battles for technological superiority covertly waged by the world's most brilliant minds.From the creation of faster, deadlier jets and rockets to the development of biological, chemical, and electronic warfare -- from astonishing advances in medical science to breakthroughs in radar and decoding -- the incredible successes and failures that occurred in top-secret facilities around the world in the early 1940s never made headlines but often determined triumph and defeat. Here, also, are the intensely human stories of the architects of the terrifying war machines -- men and women of rare intelligence and integrity torn by the conflicting demands of conscience and country, haunted by their roles in the use and abuse of powerful science.Edifying, enthralling, startling, and sobering, Terrors and Marvels is a masterful work that sheds light on the astonishing achievements of a remarkable few and the great and terrible technology that swung the pendulum of victory in the Allies' direction."

2321,"As a result of her own experience with many kind of loss, Stephanie Ericsson offers an intimate, profoundly touching guide for those in grief, legitimizing the complex and often taboo emotions we all feel when loss transforms our lives. In  Companion Through the Darkness, Stephanie Ericsson defines grief as ""the constant reawakening that things are now different."" Using a very simple format -- which combines excerpts from her own diary writings with brief essays -- she vividly speaks the language of loss and captures the contradictory, wrenching, and chaotic emotions of grief. The book can be opened at any point to chapters no more than a few pages long on such themes as:  Abandonment: The sudden state I am forced into. I no longer belong to you. I no longer belong to anyone.   Rage: The state I use to survive seemingly moments of intolerable pain.   Humor: The backside of agony.   Pity: The look on people's faces when they haven't a clue what to say to me.   Transition: The moments, strung out over months, when I know I am no longer the woman I was, but not quite the woman I am becoming.   The result is compelling, intimate, and heartbreakingly truthful -- a book that promises to be enormously sought-after support and touchstone for all those making their own journey through grief."
2322,"Brilliant, brash, and politically incorrect, Major Sean Drummond is the right man for the job. The venue is faraway South Korea. The crime is shocking by any standards, East or West. Three American soldiers - one an officer - were seen entering a Seoul apartment party with a young Korean male. The officer - now Drummond's client - is charged with strangling the Korean, and with crimes even more heinous. Ominously, the victim happens to be the son of a venerated war hero currently serving as South Korea's defense minister.But it gets even better. Drummond finds himself paired with his old law school rival, Katherine Carlson, a consummate legal brawler whose specialty is defending controversial clients. Almost immediately, Drummond is locking horns with her on issues of strategy and principle, and wondering what to make of her conflicting sexual signals. Before he knows it, he's in way over his head - the odd man out on a legal team that is antagonizing the diplomatic corps, grandstanding in the international press, and encountering lethal resistance.Struggling to stay on top of all the maneuvers, Drummond must duel with his attractive co-counsel in a tantalizing contest of wits...while confronting the machinations of a vast conspiracy that seeks to destroy him. Threatened - and seduced - by ""allies"" who may not be who they seem, Drummond will be forced to take dangerous risks to establish, once and for all, who his friends are...and who's trying to kill him."
2323,"The man who shook up American politics in 2000—and is doingso again in 2004—returns to hold both parties' feet to the fire with his straight talk about Bush, corporate government, and the whole political charade.Ralph Nader—relentless activist, brilliant visionary—may also be the most honest man we've got left in politics. And yet from the moment Nader declared his presidential candidacy on Meet the Press, he's faced relentless opposition, mainly from Democrats fearing that competition from an inspiring independent could dent their voting block ""as it did in 2000.""  Even his old pals at The Nation joined in the party panic.Now, in The Good Fight, Nader swings back harder than ever at those who ""want to block the American people from having more voices and choices"" and have lost touch with the concept that votes must be earned, not inherited or entitled. He takes on corporate-occupied Washington and the government's daily abuse against ordinary citizens: ""Corporations are saying no to the necessities of the American people. They're saying no to health insurance for everyone, no to a living wage, no to tax reform, no to straightening out the defense budget, which is bloated and redundant, no to access to our courts."" And most of all, he urges a speedy return to stronger civic motivation. If fed-up citizens don't actively join the fight for improvement, then ultimately we have no one to blame but ourselves for the inadequate checks on the erosion of our civil liberties.In an era when politicians sell us rhetoric and then sell out our principles, Nader stands as a crucial voice of candor. The Good Fight is a call to awareness and action that will captivate readers of all political stripes and help us define what we must do to shape the brightest future for our nation."

2333,"1. Children can sometimes be cruel. Why were the neighborhood children so merciless to Juanita and Scooter? What did they do to protect themselves from such cruelty? And how did their bond become stronger and more complex as they grew older? 2. Hattie is the self-sacrificing epitome of the strong Black woman. What made her this way? How did the murder of her young sister shape her views of Hispanics? What did she see in Lola that touched her heart? Why do you think she agreed to raise Juanita, and what motivated her to build such an elaborate lie surrounding Juanita’s birth and parentage? What could Lola and Pierre have done differently? 3. While Juanita experiments mildly with acts of bulimia in Chocolate Sangria , the novel is clearly not meant to address bulimia as a health issue or to resolve the crisis of bulimics in our society. Yet, what effect did Juanita’s weight and ambiguous looks have on her self-esteem? Were her efforts to make herself appear as “Black” as possible understandable? How confusing and dismaying might it have been for her to look through her family photo album and not see anyone who looked remotely like her? Is our self-identity determined by our physical features and our environment, or does it come from within? 4. Each of the main characters in Chocolate Sangria suffered tragic experiences that influenced events over the course of their lives. How did you feel about Scooter? Could his early trauma have been partially responsible for the choices he made later on in life? What was lacking in his character and in his life that made him such a willing victim to Jorge? Should he have turned himself in to the authorities for his role in the robbery, or was his shame, his stabbing, and the realization of how his father really died punishment enough? 5. What role, in your opinion, did Uncle Herbie play in Chocolate Sangria? From where did his sense of obligation and responsibility toward Hattie and Juanita spring? How helpful was he in providing balance to Hattie’s biases? In providing positive reinforcement as Juanita struggled to accept her weight and body-type? 6. The role Conan played in the death of his twin brother and the guilt he experienced as a result of Thor’s death was powerful and intense. His love for his best friend, Jorge, was also deep and profound. Do you think Conan’s guilt was a factor in his allegiance to Jorge, even when he himself felt betrayed? And after losing Thor, why did Conan draw closer to Jorge? Might it have been easier for Conan to see Jorge’s true colors if his eyes were not so clouded with grief? 7. How do you think the sadistic sexual abuse Jorge suffered as a child contributed to his outlook on non-Hispanics and his inability to feel remorse for using and abusing others, especially in terms of sexual domination? Was there something unnatural about the possessiveness he felt toward Conan, or might this type of behavior be typical of those who have experienced early trauma and suffered childhood loss? Was Jorge gay? Straight? Or simply an opportunist? 8. At the conclusion of Chocolate Sangria Scooter is at a crossroads in his life. What direction can you visualize his life taking? Did he use Sol Steinberg in much the same manner that Jorge used him? Can his friendship with Juanita be restored to its former level? How is he likely to feel about Juanita’s growing relationship with Conan? 9. In Chocolate Sangria people of color share limited resources and a common community, however, intra-racial prejudice is experienced on many levels. Why do you think minorities in America compete against each other, and what can this be attributed to? Is it realistic to think that two people, in spite of different backgrounds and family pressures, can love each other and stay happily together? 10. What is more necessary to Juanita and Conan’s lasting love: their commonalities or their differences? How does the diversity in their ethnicities bring them closer together? Juanita was obviously Black and proud. Does being pro-Black mean you must also be anti other races? 11. Which of the characters in Chocolate Sangria did you identify with the most? The least? Which is more important to human relations, tolerance or respect? What are the biggest challenges you face in tolerating, respecting or accepting others who are VERY different from you?  What would it take for you to overcome those challenges?"

Professor Yang, a respected teacher of literature at a provincial university, has had a stroke, and his student Jian Wan - who is also engaged to Yang's daughter - has been assigned to care for him. What at at first seems a simple if burdensome duty becomes treacherous when the professor begins to rave: pleading with invisible tormentors, denouncing his family, his colleagues, and a system in which a scholar is ""just a piece of meat on a cutting board.""Are these just manifestations of illness, or is Yang spewing up the truth? And can the dutiful Jian avoid being irretrievably compromised?"
2339,"Joe DiMaggio was, at every turn, one man we could look at who made us feel good.

He was Broadway Joe, the icon of elegance, the man who wooed and won Marilyn Monroe -- the most beautiful girl America could dream up.  Joe DiMaggio was a mirror of our best self. And he was also the loneliest hero we ever had.  In this groundbreaking biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Richard Ben Cramer presents a shocking portrait of a complicated, enigmatic life. The story that DiMaggio never wanted told, relates his grace and greed; his dignity, pride, and hidden shame. It is a story that sweeps through the twentieth century, bringing to light not just America's national game, but the birth (and the price) of modern national celebrity."

2341,"Narrowing the Nation's Power is the tale of how a cohesive majority of the Supreme Court has, in the last six years, cut back the power of Congress and enhanced the autonomy of the fifty states. The immunity from suit of the sovereign, Blackstone taught, is necessary to preserve the people's idea that the sovereign is ""a superior being."" Promoting the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity to constitutional status, the current Supreme Court has used it to shield the states from damages for age discrimination, disability discrimination, and the violation of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and fair labor standards. Not just the states themselves, but every state-sponsored entity--a state insurance scheme, a state university's research lab, the Idaho Potato Commission&#151;has been insulated from paying damages in tort or contract. Sovereign immunity, as Noonan puts it, has metastasized. ""It only hurts when you think about it,"" Noonan's Yalewoman remarks.Crippled by the states' immunity, Congress has been further brought to heel by the Supreme Court's recent invention of two rules. The first rule: Congress must establish a documentary record that a national evil exists before Congress can legislate to protect life, liberty, or property under the Fourteenth Amendment. The second rule: The response of Congress to the evil must then be both ""congruent"" and ""proportionate."" The Supreme Court determines whether these standards are met, thereby making itself the master monitor of national legislation. Even legislation under the Commerce Clause has been found wanting, illustrated here by the story of Christy Brzonkala's attempt to redress multiple rapes at a state university by invoking the Violence Against Women Act. The nation's power has been remarkably narrowed.Noonan is a passionate believer in the place of persons in the law. Rules, he claims, are a necessary framework, but they must not obscure law's task of giving justice to persons. His critique of Supreme Court doctrine is driven by this conviction."

Never one to take himself, or anything else for that matter, too seriously.  He’ll never say no to a woman and he’ll even let them stay the night, as long as they cook breakfast of course and as long as they never, ever, ask when he’ll be back.

He loves, he leaves and when he occasionally wrestles with his conscience, he always wins.  Well, almost             always. . .    With sales of over a million copies since its first publication in 1966, Alfie is a controversial modern classic.  The inspiration for the cult film starring Michael Caine and the smash-hit remake with Jude Law as the eponymous anti-hero, Alfie feels as fresh and relevant today as when it was first published."

2350,"The genome's been mapped.  But what does it mean?Arguably the most significant scientific discoveru of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers.

2361,"This compact guide provides the jump-start Oracle developers need to make the transition from traditional programming to the development of useful Web applications for Oracle8i. Even readers who start out knowing nothing about HTML, PL/SQL, or Oracle's other tools will learn how to create simple Web applications in a matter of days. The book focuses on Oracle8i, but also covers Web development for earlier Oracle versions (Oracle8 and Oracle7).Background:The explosion in the use of the Internet and the Web has resulted in a whole new way of doing business. Developers who only yesterday were using COBOL to write accounts payable systems are now being asked to create a broad range of new Internet-based applications ranging from electronic commerce (e-commerce) Web sites to internal data warehouses to enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unfortunately, the filesystem architectures of most Web systems aren't up to the task. The new breed of Web applications -- which are quickly becoming critical resources that companies need to survive -- demand a platform that provides production-quality tools for content management, application development, and application integration. And current Web techniques are inadequate in many ways.Oracle8i, Oracle's ""Internet database,"" gives Web developers a way to build Web technology on top of a relational database, rather than on a traditional filesystem. With Oracle8i, companies can apply well understood, reliable, production-quality database methodologies to Web content management. Oracle8i also supports a wide variety of application development platforms and tools that are tightly integrated to the core database. Finally, Oracle8i supports technologies that help companies tie their Web-based applications into legacy applications.There is a lot to learn in Oracle8i. Not only does it enhance basic database features, it introduces Java and a variety of Web development tools. Oracle8i provides a soup-to-nuts platform for Web site and Web application development that extends traditional database concepts to Web content. It replaces the traditional filesystem used by most Web servers with a database management system.Many users are intimidated by the vast array of new technologies in Oracle8i. And yet, they are under pressure to use these technologies to build complex Web applications right now. This book gives such users a way to start using Oracle8i immediately to create useful Web applications. It is a concise, easy-to-read guide to the basic technologies developers need to understand in order to build Web applications.Contains:The book describes the following Web development tools:PL/SQL-- a structured programming language that combines procedural constructs and standard SQL. It offers such features as cursors, loops, conditional and sequential control statements, exception handlers, records, tables, and constructs for developing modular code (functions, procedures, and packages). PL/SQL Toolkit -- a set of PL/SQL packages supplied by Oracle for use in developing Web applications.HTML -- an ASCII-based markup language used to create Web pages.WebDB -- A software system for building, monitoring, and creating content-driven Web sites; it allows users to use a Web browser to access and store information in the Oracle8i database.Oracle Application Server (OAS) -- an extensible Web server that uses plug-in programs called cartridges to allow database-integrated Web systems to be developed in a variety of languages (e.g., PL/SQL, Java, Perl).XML -- An emerging standard for creating self-describing documents. It is similar to HTML but allows you to create your own markup tags. XML is expected to be a key technology in electronic commerce systems.The book also presents several fully realized sample Web applications that w"

2366,"Master of mystery Robert Barnard, internationally acclaimed for his suspenseful, witty literary gems, cleverly mixes past and present in A Cry from the Dark, an intriguing tour de force sweeping from 1930s Australia to contemporary London. Bettina Whitelaw has come a long way from her childhood in the little outback town of Bundaroo, Australia. Many years have passed, a lifetime really, but she's never forgotten what happened there on the evening that changed her life forever.How could she forget the school dance, her taunting classmates, dancing with the strange but brilliant English boy, Hughie Naismyth? How could she forget what happened next, when, overheated and exhilarated by the music and the moment, she wandered off alone into a secluded, wooded area? Now a renowned, elderly author living in London's elegant Holland Park, Bettina faces a flood of memories as she works on her memoirs, even though her focus is more on the frightening things that are happening today. Someone has recently entered her home and gone through her desk. The intruder is clearly not an ordinary burglar. It must be someone she knows. She's been a little lax in handing out keys, so the suspects are many -- her nephew, Mark; her agent, Clare; her friends, Peter or Katie. Or it could be someone else.What does Bettina possess that this person would want to steal? A puzzle that at first seems mildly disturbing soon turns deadly serious. Someone is willing to kill -- but why? Does the answer rest in Bundaroo or nearer to home? A Cry from the Dark shows us vintage Robert Barnard as he slyly lays the clues that lead to his trademark surprise -- and poignant -- ending."
2367,"From the acclaimed author of the national bestseller Ahab's Wife comes an inspiring, brilliantly rendered new novel of the awakening conscience of the South and of an entire nation.Written with the same scope and emotional depth as her previous award-winning novel, Four Spirits is set in Sena Jeter Naslund's home city of Birmingham, Alabama, a city that in the 1960s was known as Bombingham. Naslund brings to life this tumultuous time, weaving together the lives of blacks and whites, civil rights advocates and racists, and the events of peaceful protest and violent repression, to create a tapestry of American social transformation.Stella Silver is an idealistic, young white college student brought up by her genteel, mannered aunts. She first witnesses the events of the freedom movement from a safe distance but, along with her friend Cat Cartwright, is soon drawn into the mounting conflagration. Stella's and Cat's lives are forever altered by their new friendships with other committed freedom fighters.A student at a black college, Christine Taylor is inspired to action by the examples of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. She courageously struggles to balance her family responsibilities, education, and work with the passions and dangers of the demonstrations. Her friend Gloria Callahan, a gifted young cellist and descendant of a runaway slave, tries to move beyond her personal shyness and family coziness to enter a wider circle, including blacks and whites, men and women, all involved with the protests. Lionel Parrish, teacher, preacher, and peddler of funeral insurance, battles his own demons of lust and self-preservation, while New York activist Jonathan Green gives up a promising career as a pianist to work for racial justice in the South.These characters all add their voices to the chorus that makes up this symphony of innocent children and the mythic elderly, the devoutly religious and the skeptical humanist, the wealthy and the poor, the city and the country. Poignant and evocative, rich in historical detail, and filled with the humanity that is the hallmark of Naslund's fiction, Four Spirits is a compelling tale that transcends tragedy and evokes redemptive triumph."

2372,"One of America's most popular personal finance experts reveals how you can become happier at any income level through better money management  Millions of Americans have turned to Jean Chatzky for financial advice, thanks to her weekly appearances on NBC's Today and her column in Money magazine. Now, in You Don't Have to Be Rich, she analyzes the results of a unique survey in which she questioned 1,500 Americans about their financial attitudes and behaviors. She looks at how much money people actually do need to guarantee a happy, comfortable life. And gets down to the nitty-gritty, isolating behaviors that-if adopted-can significantly improve a life.  The results of this proprietary survey-conducted with the help of the Roper Center-are remarkable. Chatzky found that while a certain amount of money buys comfort, money can't make you happy-at least not in the way most people believe it can. But it can make you miserable, if you're managing it wrong. That's why it's time to make a change.  In her frank, engaging style, Chatzky explains how to ""own your money"" to create a happy and comfortable life. She outlines the financial habits of happy people and shows how anyone can be a part of this group, no matter what they earn. Filled with fresh insights and real life examples, You Don't Have to Be Rich reaffirms that finances don't have to be a source of stress and that living within your means can be extremely rewarding."

2375,"Ronald Reagan is hailed today for a presidency that restored optimism to America, engendered years of economic prosperity, and helped bring about the fall of the Soviet Union. Yet until now little attention has been paid to the role Reagan's personal spirituality played in his political career, shaping his ideas, bolstering his resolve, and ultimately compelling him to confront the brutal -- and, not coincidentally, atheistic -- Soviet empire.In this groundbreaking book, political historian Paul Kengor draws upon Reagan's legacy of speeches and correspondence, and the memories of those who knew him well, to reveal a man whose Christian faith remained deep and consistent throughout his more than six decades in public life. Raised in the Disciples of Christ Church by a devout mother with a passionate missionary streak, Reagan embraced the church after reading a Christian novel at the age of eleven. A devoted Sunday-school teacher, he absorbed the church's model of ""practical Christianity"" and strived to achieve it in every stage of his life.But it was in his lifelong battle against communism -- first in Hollywood, then on the political stage -- that Reagan's Christian beliefs had their most profound effect. Appalled by the religious repression and state-mandated atheism of Bolshevik Marxism, Reagan felt called by a sense of personal mission to confront the USSR. Inspired by influences as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Whittaker Chambers, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he waged an openly spiritual campaign against communism, insisting that religious freedom was the bedrock of personal liberty. ""The source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual,"" he said in his Evil Empire address. ""And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man.""From a church classroom in 1920s Dixon, Illinois, to his triumphant mission to Moscow in 1988, Ronald Reagan was both political leader and spiritual crusader. God and Ronald Reagan deepens immeasurably our understanding of how these twin missions shaped his presidency -- and changed the world."
2376,"Michael T. Isenberg has chronicled, in the first of a projected two-volume study, the historic institution of the United States Navy in the Cold War era. Shield of the Republic, a definitive work on the era, demonstrates both a narrative sweep and a command of style that are rare in works of modern history.The overarching themes of the book are the emergence of the two superpower nations between 1945 and 1962 and an examination of the technologies that rang down the curtain on the Mahanian age of sail. At the conclusion of World War II, naval leaders confronted a drastically redrawn world and, like the rest of the American people, found the adjustment to the bitter, suspicion-riddled years of the 1950s to be both challenging and unsettling.The Korean War, fought largely with World War II equipment, settled much of the debate over what new naval roles and capacities were to be, and emphasized the nature of Pax Americana, which, whatever else the phrase implied, meant American naval hegemony on the oceans of the world, a military dominance that came to its bone-chilling conclusion during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.Shield of the Republic is the epic story of these dramatic seventeen years following the Japanese surrender, a time when the Navy struggled to find its strategic footing in the shadow of the atomic bomb, on the slippery ground of interservice rivalry, and amid the frightening realities of superpower conflict. Naval leaders, from the flinty Ernest King to the brilliant Forrest Sherman to the hard-driving Arleigh Burke, battled to keep their beloved service on an even keel while changing its makeup to meet the numerous and unexpected problems of the new era.Unlike many naval histories that consider the Navy merely as an adjunct of American international relations, Shield of the Republic examines the Navy from the inside out and from the keel plates up. Particular attention is paid the rapid and bewildering acceleration of naval technology, from the lurking nuclear ballistic missile submarine to the missile-firing destroyer to the marvels of supersonic jet aircraft, and it is in these descriptions where Isenberg's language soars. The men who worked with these technological wonders receive full treatment, from the youngest boot to the saltiest admiral, from the women who were for decades relegated to support positions, to the most powerful political leaders, like Harry Truman (who liked sailors but distrusted most admirals), and John Kennedy (whose much-vaunted wartime naval adventures were a bit short of what they were cooked up to be).And wherever the bows of the Cold War Navy cut water, they invariably brought with them American economic imperialism - the self-assurance of the only nation to emerge practically unscathed from World War II. The unique global reach of this Cold War Navy meant that the first taste of Americanism which many foreigners ever had often came in Navy blue and gold.Using the Navy as a fitting symbol for American foreign policy during these years, Michael T. Isenberg has created a sweeping saga, an enduring work, that will be appreciated both by naval experts and by general readers alike."

2390,"The powerful memoir of a young black woman coming of age in South Africa amid the violence of apartheid, beautifully written by her brother, the bestselling author of Kaffir Boy.  Mark Mathabane first came to prominence with the publication of Kaffir Boy, which became a New York Times bestseller.  His story of growing up in South Africa was one of the most riveting accounts of life under apartheid. Mathabane's newest book, Miriam's Song, is the story of Mark's sister, who was left behind in South Africa. It is the gripping tale of a woman -- representative of an entire generation -- who came of age amid the violence and rebellion of the 1980s and finally saw the destruction of apartheid and the birth of a new and democratic South Africa.  Mathabane writes in Miriam's voice, based on stories she told him, but he has re-created her unforgettable experience as only someone who also lived through it could. The immediacy of the hardships that brother and sister endured -- from daily school beatings to near-overwhelming poverty -- is balanced by the beauty of their childhood observations and the true affection that they have for each other. Miriam emerges as both an innocent child drawn into the war against apartheid and a strong woman forever changed by the struggles, brutality, and politics of the world around her; Mark emerges once more as a writer of extraordinary ability, sensitivity, and insight.  Miriam's Song is memoir writing at its finest. With its courage, determination, resilience, hope, and faith, it is a truly inspirational story, spectacularly told."

2394,"David's entire twelve-year life has been spent in a grisly prison camp in Eastern Europe. He knows nothing of the outside world. But when he is given the chance to escape, he seizes it. With his vengeful enemies hot on his heels, David struggles to cope in this strange new world, where his only resources are a compass, a few crusts of bread, his two aching feet, and some vague advice to seek refuge in Denmark. Is that enough to survive? David's extraordinary odyssey is dramatically chronicled in Anne Holm's classic about the meaning of freedom and the power of hope."
2395,"The Perreaus and Mrs. Rudd tells the remarkable story of a complex forgery uncovered in London in 1775. Like the trials of Martin Guerre and O.J. Simpson, the Perreau-Rudd case—filled with scandal, deceit, and mystery—preoccupied a public hungry for sensationalism. Peopled with such familiar figures as John Wilkes, King George III, Lord Mansfield, and James Boswell, this story reveals the deep anxieties of this period of English capitalism. The case acts as a prism that reveals the hopes, fears, and prejudices of that society. Above all, this episode presents a parable of the 1770s, when London was the center of European finance and national politics, of fashionable life and tell-all journalism, of empire achieved and empire lost. The crime, a hanging offense, came to light with the arrest of identical twin brothers, Robert and Daniel Perreau, after the former was detained trying to negotiate a forged bond. At their arraignment they both accused Daniel's mistress, Margaret Caroline Rudd, of being responsible for the crime. The brothers' trials coincided with the first reports of bloodshed in the American colonies at Lexington and Concord and successfully competed for space in the newspapers. From March until the following January, people could talk of little other than the fate of the Perreaus and the impending trial of Mrs. Rudd. The participants told wildly different tales and offered strikingly different portraits of themselves. The press was filled with letters from concerned or angry correspondents. The public, deeply divided over who was guilty, was troubled by evidence that suggested not only that fair might be foul, but that it might not be possible to decide which was which. While the decade of the 1770s has most frequently been studied in relation to imperial concerns and their impact upon the political institutions of the day, this book draws a different portrait of the period, making a cause célèbre its point of entry. Exhaustively researched and brilliantly presented, it offers both a vivid panorama of London and a gauge for tracking the shifting social currents of the period."
2396,"A manifesto for an aggressive liberal response to terrorist attacks. One of our most brilliant public intellectuals, Paul Berman has spent his career writing on revolutionary movements and their totalitarian aspects. Here he argues that, in the terror war, we are not facing a battle of the West against Islama clash of civilizations. We are facing, instead, the same battle that tore apart Europe during most of the twentieth century, only in a new version. It is the clash of liberalism and its enemiesthe battle between freedom and totalitarianism that arose in Europe many years ago and spread to the Muslim world. The author considers the wars against fascism and communism from the past, and draws cautionary lessons. But he also draws from those past experiences a liberal program for the presenta program that departs in fundamental respects from the policies of the Bush administration."
2397,"Meet Inspector Sejer: smart and enigmatic, tough but fair. At the foot of the imposing Kollen Mountain lies a small, idyllic village, where neighbors know neighbors and children play happily in the streets. But when the body of a teenage girl is found by the lake at the mountaintop, the town's tranquility is shattered forever. Annie was strong, intelligent, and loved by everyone. What went so terribly wrong? Doggedly, yet subtly, Inspector Sejer uncovers layer upon layer of distrust and lies beneath the town's seemingly perfect façade. Critically acclaimed across Europe, Karin Fossum's Inspector Sejer novels are masterfully constructed, psychologically convincing, and compulsively readable. They evoke a world that is at once profoundly disturbing and terrifyingly familiar."
2398,"The bestselling author of The Discipline of Market Leaders reveals how companies can achieve sustained growth.  In their 1995 blockbuster The Discipline of Market Leaders, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema explained how great companies dominated their markets by offering superior value propositions. Now Treacy is back with an equally groundbreaking book-revealing how great companies master growth each year and how all businesses can identify and exploit opportunities for increased revenues, gross margins, and profits.  Treacy's main point is simple-it really is possible to grow your business by 10 percent or more, year after year, in good times and bad, without cheating. Great companies already know how to do it, and the rest of us can learn their strategies and do the same thing. Using case studies from industry leaders such as Dell Computer, Home Depot, and GE, he shows the five steps that are imperative to ensure growth:  ? keep the growth you have already earned ? look for growth where it's likely to be found ? take business from your competitors  Treacy believes that any business can grow at a consistent double-digit rate, and with Double-Digit Growth, managers and investors now have the tools to achieve that lofty goal and maintain corporate success."
2399,"It had all the ingredients of a movie drama:a scandal that grips Washington and touches the White House; bitter battles and backroom intrigue at the highest levels of the U.S. military; glamorous women who make or break the careers of powerful men; a high-stakes trial with a celebrity defendant who captures the nation's attention ...A Question of Loyalty plunges into the seven-week Washington trial of Gen. William ""Billy"" Mitchell, the hero of the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and the man who proved in 1921 that planes could sink a battleship. In 1925 Mitchell was frustrated by the slow pace of aviation development, and he sparked a political firestorm, accusing the army and navy high commands, and by inference the president, of treason and criminal negligence in the way they conducted national defense. He was put on trial for insubordination in a spectacular court-martial that became a national obsession during the Roaring Twenties.Douglas Waller has crafted a compelling new biography of the daring Billy Mitchell, a larger-than-life figure remembered as much for his outspokenness as for his innovations in the use of airpower. Waller has uncovered a trove of new letters, diaries, and confidential documents that have enabled him to capture in detail the drama of the court and to build a rich and revealing biography of Mitchell, one of the army's most controversial and flamboyant generals.Born to a millionaire Midwest family at the end of the 1870s, Mitchell joined the military at the age of eighteen and became one of its rising stars. During World War I, he led the largest armada of airplanes ever to attack an enemy force and returned to the United States a dashing young general with a chest full of medals and a radical vision of airpower as the only decisive instrument for future wars. But as the military shrank in the postwar years, Mitchell became increasingly impatient and vocal, lashing out at bureaucratic enemies he accused of impeding airpower's progress. After a tragic airship accident that shocked the nation, he publicly blasted the War and Navy Departments for their handling of aviation and was put on trial for it.A Question of Loyalty is a story about Washington politics, about love and betrayal, about heroes in battle, about determined lawyers and powerful military men pitted against one another in a courtroom."
2400,"At the beginning of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution lured many Americans from farms to the cities, creating new opportunities and new limitations for women. Some women were forced to look for work in the few occupations open to them, while others became full-time homemakers. Americans constructed new ways of thinking about the ""proper roles"" of women and men, with women as the moral educators in the private sphere of home and church while men participated in the public sphere of business and politics. By 1848, with the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, some women were exposing how these conditions and ideas kept them from achieving their highest potential. Even before this revolutionary event, women mill workers, African-American slaves, and others were resisting their oppressive conditions in a variety of ways. Michael Goldberg shows readers how women began to understand their ability to influence events through education, religion, and anti-slavery societies, and he discusses the hopes and concerns about marriage and courtship of both slave and free women, and how changes in personal relationships reflected changes in society at large. Emma Willard, one of the earliest proponents of expanded female education, Margaret Fuller, abolitionists Angelina and Sarah Grimkï¿½, Mother Seton, Lucy Stone, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Lydia Maria Child are but a few who left their marks as women began breaking new ground."
2401,"After a freak accident, Douglas's twin brother is dead, and his family's fragmentation begins. His mother packs up their home in Cape Town and takes him to a tiny backwater town in the semi-desert Karoo region, where she withdraws into her painting. Douglas, a city kid in an insular community, makes only two friends: a beautiful girl named Marika, with her adventurous spirit and tyrannical father; and an old garage worker named Moses, with his junkyard Volvo and dreams of driving away to Cape Town.  Against the backdrop of the bitter conflict of 1970s South Africa, Douglas develops a clearer insight into himself and his place in the world, a world where dreams and reality meet in a surprising twist. Blazing with color and light, Karoo Boy offers a sensuous and lyrical evocation of South Africa that leaves a lasting impression and ultimately ends on a note of hope."

Ranging widely across time and languages, Andrew Vogel Ettin explores the ways in which various biblical and traditional works as well as modern and contemporary texts- Jewish and non-Jewish, religious and literary- treat the nature of silence and speech and the tension between them. He situates this tension at the heart of the creative process and argues that language and silence need each other and contribute to the power and meaning of one another.Speaking Silence is a broadly interdisciplinary work that will appeal to scholars and readers interested in modern and contemporary literature, Jewish studies, religion and literature, and aesthetics."

This anthology of the longest-running poetry series in the United States tells the story of American poetry in this century. At first a forum for a conservative taste in parochial college verse, the Younger Poets Series soon opened up to unconventional but profound young talents from across the country?such as James Agee, Muriel Rukeyser, Margaret Walker, William Meredith, Adrienne Rich, John Ashbery, John Hollander, James Tate, Carolyn Forché, and Robert Hass. This anthology includes poems from the first book by each of the 92 winners of the annual Younger Poets contest.The selections are accompanied by an introduction by George Bradley, the 1986 winner of the contest.

2426,"For a generation, Muslim extremists have targeted Americans in an escalation of terror that culminated in the September 11 attacks. Our shared confusion -- Who are the attackers? Why are we targets? -- is cleared away in a book as dramatic as it is authoritative.  Updated with new chapters on Afghanistan and the the broader Islamic movement, Sacred Rage combines Robin Wright's extraordinary reportage on the Islamic world with an historian's grasp of context to explain the roots, the motives, and the goals of the Islamic resurgence. Wright talked to terrorists, militant religious leaders, and fighters from Beirut to Islamabad and Kabul. Their voices of rage reverberate here -- right up to the attacks in New York and Washington.  Across continents extends a challenge we fail to understand at our peril. Sacred Rage now casts light on the war being fought in the shadows."

She has suffered the unexpected and inexplicable loss of her mother in childbirth; her father, an overworked doctor grown callous with stress, has neither the ability nor the interest to take on the difficult task of raising his child alone; her grandmother, Thomasina, has decided to abscond to Egypt with a retired general rather than acknowledge and accept the loss of her daughter, whom she loved so distressingly well. And so Faith finds herself improbably at the rearing of her father’s brother, Jack, an ascetic priest whose current endeavor is an occult ?experimental community” comprised mainly of expatriate Tibetans. What ensues is a brilliant comedy of manners that revives the tradition begun by Jane Austen?an endlessly charming passage through the North and South of England that finally gives a major and lavishly gifted award-winning British writer the American readership she so richly deserves."

But none of that matters when he is cut from his local travel team, the very same team his father led to national prominence as a boy.

They were a new pop-culture breed of American warrior unrecognizable to their forebears—soldiers raised on hip hop, video games and The Real World. Cocky, brave, headstrong, wary and mostly unprepared for the physical, emotional and moral horrors ahead, the “First Suicide Battalion” would spearhead the blitzkrieg on Iraq, and fight against the hardest resistance Saddam had to offer.Hailed as “one of the best books to come out of the Iraq war”(Financial Times), Generation Kill is the funny, frightening, and profane firsthand account of these remarkable men, of the personal toll of victory, and of the randomness, brutality and camaraderie of a new American War."
2437,"Dan Savage is irreverent, irrepressible, and opinionated. He's held his own on Politically Incorrect, told tales on This American Life, continues to write a beloved nationally syndicated column-and he's had it up to here (my hand is higher than my head) with the moral, conservative scolds who proclaim America is slouching towards Gomorrah (to use Robert Bork's phrase). Are we really that bad?  Yes, we are! And in Skipping Towards Gomorrah, Dan Savage eviscerates those cynics as he commits each of the Seven Deadly Sins himself (or tries to) and finds those everyday Americans who take particular delight in their sinful pursuits. Among them:  Greed: Gamblers reveal secrets behind outrageous fortune. Lust: ""We're swingers!""-you won't believe who's doing it. Gluttony: Dan meets gluttons with attitude at a pro-fat conference. Sloth: Leave it to Dan to find a way to celebrate this sin that will get him in trouble with his mother. Anger: Texans shoot off some rounds and then listen to Dan fire off on his own about guns, control, and the Second Amendment. Envy: Meet the rich-then be glad you're not one of them. Pride: You'll never look at a gay pride parade the same way again.  Couple all this sinning with a unique history of the Seven Deadly Sins, a new interpretation of the biblical stories of Sodom and Gomorrah, and enough Bork, Bennett, Buchanan, et al, bashing to more than make up for their incessant carping, and you've got the most provocative book of the fall."

2448,"Few avenues of scientific inquiry raise more thorny ethical questions than the cloning of human beings, a radical way to control our DNA. In August 2001, in conjunction with his decision to permit limited federal funding for stem-cell research, President George W. Bush created the President's Council on Bioethics to address the ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation. Over the past year the Council, whose members comprise a team of leading scientists, doctors, ethicists, lawyers, humanists, and theologians, has discussed and debated the pros and cons of cloning, whether in the service of producing children or as an aid to scientific research. The questions the Council members confronted do not have easy answers, and they did not seek to hide theirdifferences behind an artificial consensus. Rather, the Council decided to allow each side to make its own best case, so that the American people can think about and debate these questions, which go to the heart of what it means to be a human being. Justas the dawn of the atomic age created ethical dilemmas for the United States, cloning presents us with similar quandaries that we are sure to wrestle with for decades to come.Presents the report submitted by the President's Council on Bioethics, including historical aspects of cloning, public policy options and recommendations, and ethical aspects of cloning."

Or is it the conservatives who have identified media bias as a reliably inflammatory rallying cry around which to consolidate their political base as they cynically “work the refs?” The media has become so pervasive in our lives that regardless of exactly where on the ideological fence you sit, the question of media bias has become all but unavoidable.Most of the criticism (and anger) has so far emanated from the political Right, which has offered us the rather unconvincing argument that a systematic Left bias is destroying the quality of news and debate in our country today. Journalist and historian Eric Alterman begs to differ.What Liberal Media? confronts the question of liberal bias and, in so doing, provides a sharp and utterly convincing assessment of the realities of political bias in the news. In distinct contrast to the conclusions reached by Ann Coulter, Bernard Goldberg, Sean Hannity, and Bill O’Reilly, Alterman finds the media to be, on the whole, far more conservative than liberal, though it is possible to find evidence for both views. The fact that conservatives howl so much louder and more effectively than liberals is one significant reason that big media is always on its guard for “liberal” bias but gives conservative bias a free pass. After reading What Liberal Media? you will understand that the real news story of recent years is not whether this newspaper, or that news anchor, is biased but rather to what extent the entire news industry is organized to communicate conservative views and push our politics to the right—regardless of how “liberal” any given reporter may be."

2499,"In the year 2000--and beyond--what will the church be like? What challenges will it face? Will the church be able to provide a strong sense of community? Will it be an ethical force in the lives of Americans? And what role will religion play in politics and in the marketplace?In Christianity in the 21st Century Robert Wuthnow reflects on these provocative questions as he seeks to identify changes that are taking place now in American society that churches must address if they are to remain vital in the future. He foresees five critical areas--institutional, ethical, doctrinal, political, and cultural--in which major challenges will arise, then meets the thorny issues head-on. How will churches' resource bases, their very identity, and their capacity to carry on their spiritual traditions be altered? till they continue to function as sources of caring in a needy world? What impact will the resurgence of fundamentalism have, and how will moderate and liberal congregations react? How will the political activities of churches influence their capacity to be heard in the public arena, and what will the impact be of pluralism and the prevailing materialism of our society?Drawing on a wide range of first-hand observations and research, Wuthnow demontrates that in each of these five areas people of faith have strong reasons to enter the next century with confidence in their religious institutions. But he also highlights worrisome signs, and points to specific areas that need to be addressed to ensure the continuing vitality for Christianity in America--not least among these are the rampant individualism that erodes spiritual communities and the religious infighting that diminishes the Christian sense of unity.The onset of a new millennium affords a historic opportunity to take stock of the present situation and to plan for the future--in the years ahead, much reflection is likely to occur about all our major institutions.Christianity in the 21st Century aims to contribute to those reflections by offering a sobering, realistic, and ultimately hopeful assessment of where the church is now, and where the church is headed."
2500,"This book helps teenagers understand how to think clearly and biblically about supernatural events. Every day we hear of supernatural phenomenon—from Ouija boards to crop circles to psychics on TV—and it’s difficult for teens to know how to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit occurrences. Author Mark Matlock, who has conducted a research project with Barna Research on Teens and the Supernatural and is a member of the international community of illusionists, presents clear principles and intriguing examples that teach teens how to respond to the supernatural with wisdom, discernment, and without being duped. Using the Acts community at Berea as a model, Matlock identifies “thinking traps” that lead to deception, such as not balancing the mind and emotions, mixing truth with lies, and making false association. With clarity, he shows readers how to find Christ, and provides biblical answers to frequently asked questions about such things as Ouija boards, psychics, angels, and demons. Upside-down.
